[Music]

0:00:05.120,0:00:08.480
hey hey welcome back

0:00:06.319,0:00:10.000
it's day three uh i'm here with my

0:00:08.480,0:00:11.360
campers again i'll go and let them

0:00:10.000,0:00:14.639
introduce themselves again hi

0:00:11.360,0:00:18.000
i'm lila hi i'm bowen

0:00:14.639,0:00:19.920
hi i'm i'm mckinley hi i'm keegan

0:00:18.000,0:00:21.760
all right we've got all our campers here

0:00:19.920,0:00:22.480
today uh what we're going to be doing

0:00:21.760,0:00:25.359
today

0:00:22.480,0:00:26.720
is um making a game about fish if you

0:00:25.359,0:00:28.640
choose a fish theme

0:00:26.720,0:00:30.160
uh but before we hop in let's just kind

0:00:28.640,0:00:31.599
of quickly glance at some things we

0:00:30.160,0:00:33.280
learned last time so

0:00:31.599,0:00:35.200
one of the big things we learned last

0:00:33.280,0:00:36.640
time is that we learned how to draw

0:00:35.200,0:00:38.239
right so we learned about these drawing

0:00:36.640,0:00:40.000
tools we're going to continue our

0:00:38.239,0:00:42.000
drawing tools some this time

0:00:40.000,0:00:43.280
last time it was for the background and

0:00:42.000,0:00:44.399
so this time we're going to draw a

0:00:43.280,0:00:46.800
sprite together

0:00:44.399,0:00:48.640
which should be fun we're also going to

0:00:46.800,0:00:51.280
learn like a new way of movement

0:00:48.640,0:00:52.800
so before we did avery walking where she

0:00:51.280,0:00:55.360
followed the mouse pointer around

0:00:52.800,0:00:57.280
that was how she moved uh the hedgehog

0:00:55.360,0:00:59.199
moved with this up down left right

0:00:57.280,0:01:01.440
keys and then this time we're going to

0:00:59.199,0:01:03.600
move in a different way that i call

0:01:01.440,0:01:05.439
a race car movement we're also going to

0:01:03.600,0:01:07.520
learn about something at the very end

0:01:05.439,0:01:09.920
called broadcasting events so we'll get

0:01:07.520,0:01:12.240
into that let's look at a solution

0:01:09.920,0:01:14.000
for what we're trying to build today so

0:01:12.240,0:01:17.119
mine is called fish lunch

0:01:14.000,0:01:18.880
so this version was made by bob um and

0:01:17.119,0:01:19.360
the idea of this game is that you're the

0:01:18.880,0:01:21.920
fish

0:01:19.360,0:01:23.040
so i'm nemo here and nemo's trying to

0:01:21.920,0:01:24.640
eat his food

0:01:23.040,0:01:27.280
so there he just kind of made it to some

0:01:24.640,0:01:29.840
food and you're trying not to let these

0:01:27.280,0:01:31.680
these things hit you one feature that

0:01:29.840,0:01:33.600
you kind of see is i sped up nemo there

0:01:31.680,0:01:36.400
so nemo actually got a little faster

0:01:33.600,0:01:38.079
so i can use the up and down arrow keys

0:01:36.400,0:01:40.240
and then i hit some trash and so i got a

0:01:38.079,0:01:41.600
score of three that time

0:01:40.240,0:01:42.880
but you can see that there's a lot going

0:01:41.600,0:01:43.520
on because we have to worry about our

0:01:42.880,0:01:46.159
hero

0:01:43.520,0:01:47.119
that's nemo we have to be able to speed

0:01:46.159,0:01:48.560
up nemo

0:01:47.119,0:01:51.520
and then we also have to be able to slow

0:01:48.560,0:01:52.479
down nemo nemo can swim backwards as

0:01:51.520,0:01:54.320
well

0:01:52.479,0:01:55.520
we've got the food that we're going to

0:01:54.320,0:01:57.439
draw um

0:01:55.520,0:01:58.799
and then we've got all these enemies

0:01:57.439,0:02:01.280
that are around us as well

0:01:58.799,0:02:02.479
so don't be surprised if uh today takes

0:02:01.280,0:02:04.000
a little longer

0:02:02.479,0:02:05.520
that's designed by the camp the first

0:02:04.000,0:02:06.240
day kind of an intro the second one it's

0:02:05.520,0:02:08.399
a little harder

0:02:06.240,0:02:09.920
the third is the hardest day in general

0:02:08.399,0:02:11.599
and then we start tapering down summer

0:02:09.920,0:02:12.879
at the end so don't be surprised

0:02:11.599,0:02:15.040
if you need a couple breaks in this

0:02:12.879,0:02:15.599
video but let's go ahead and dive right

0:02:15.040,0:02:17.760
in

0:02:15.599,0:02:21.040
and go and get started so go ahead and

0:02:17.760,0:02:23.280
visit scratch.mit.edu

0:02:21.040,0:02:25.280
click on create and it will bring you to

0:02:23.280,0:02:26.959
a new project

0:02:25.280,0:02:28.640
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:02:26.959,0:02:30.560
make my theme

0:02:28.640,0:02:33.040
similar to what this one was so fish

0:02:30.560,0:02:33.519
themed if you want to use a different

0:02:33.040,0:02:35.440
theme

0:02:33.519,0:02:38.400
you can but what i'm going to do is i'm

0:02:35.440,0:02:40.640
going to choose choose a sprite

0:02:38.400,0:02:42.400
and for me i'm going to choose a fish so

0:02:40.640,0:02:43.680
here's my fish right here

0:02:42.400,0:02:45.599
this fish is kind of interesting because

0:02:43.680,0:02:47.920
he's got different costumes

0:02:45.599,0:02:49.519
so now i can delete my cat so this fish

0:02:47.920,0:02:51.440
has different costumes and sometimes

0:02:49.519,0:02:52.640
costumes are like animations

0:02:51.440,0:02:54.080
but you can see that this one has

0:02:52.640,0:02:55.120
different costumes or just completely

0:02:54.080,0:02:57.120
different fish

0:02:55.120,0:02:58.640
so i'm gonna pick the fish that i want i

0:02:57.120,0:03:01.040
really like the one that looks like nemo

0:02:58.640,0:03:02.319
i think he's fun so now i've got my fish

0:03:01.040,0:03:04.560
on here

0:03:02.319,0:03:06.480
i can change things like his size like

0:03:04.560,0:03:08.720
maybe i want him to be a little smaller

0:03:06.480,0:03:10.480
so i can have him be teeny tiny you can

0:03:08.720,0:03:11.120
pick whatever size fish you want maybe

0:03:10.480,0:03:14.159
40

0:03:11.120,0:03:14.879
would be good just like before you can

0:03:14.159,0:03:17.040
think about

0:03:14.879,0:03:19.680
his directions whether he can rotate all

0:03:17.040,0:03:22.560
around or only left right or not rotate

0:03:19.680,0:03:23.840
this one i do want to rotate all around

0:03:22.560,0:03:24.799
all right so now we've picked out our

0:03:23.840,0:03:26.799
hero

0:03:24.799,0:03:28.480
and our hero is on our screen if you did

0:03:26.799,0:03:29.599
a fish great if you did something

0:03:28.480,0:03:31.920
different that's fine

0:03:29.599,0:03:33.280
let's do some code first thing we want

0:03:31.920,0:03:34.080
to add campers where do you think we

0:03:33.280,0:03:37.519
need to start

0:03:34.080,0:03:39.599
click on the green flag yeah so event

0:03:37.519,0:03:43.200
when green flag clicked so this is where

0:03:39.599,0:03:44.640
we start a lot of our games

0:03:43.200,0:03:46.400
and then eventually we're going to have

0:03:44.640,0:03:47.599
a forever loop but before we do the

0:03:46.400,0:03:49.280
forever loop

0:03:47.599,0:03:51.360
i first want to set his starting

0:03:49.280,0:03:53.920
position and his starting direction

0:03:51.360,0:03:55.840
so decide where your fish or whatever

0:03:53.920,0:03:57.280
your hero is is going to start your game

0:03:55.840,0:03:58.959
so i'm going to choose to start in just

0:03:57.280,0:04:00.720
a lower left corner but you can do it

0:03:58.959,0:04:02.799
wherever you want

0:04:00.720,0:04:05.360
once you position them in that location

0:04:02.799,0:04:09.439
you can go to motion

0:04:05.360,0:04:11.840
and find this go to xy

0:04:09.439,0:04:13.599
and again what's nice about this command

0:04:11.840,0:04:15.840
is if you've moved the fish to where you

0:04:13.599,0:04:16.720
want so here it's negative 168 negative

0:04:15.840,0:04:18.400
129

0:04:16.720,0:04:20.320
you can see that that command the

0:04:18.400,0:04:22.079
arguments those things in whites

0:04:20.320,0:04:23.280
auto update to where he's at which is

0:04:22.079,0:04:24.080
kind of nice that's why i put him in

0:04:23.280,0:04:26.960
position

0:04:24.080,0:04:28.080
first before i add that command and then

0:04:26.960,0:04:30.000
i'm going to grab

0:04:28.080,0:04:32.320
something that says point in direction

0:04:30.000,0:04:34.400
90. this is so that my fish

0:04:32.320,0:04:36.560
starts going this way when the game

0:04:34.400,0:04:38.880
begins

0:04:36.560,0:04:40.960
now we're ready for our forever loop so

0:04:38.880,0:04:43.680
very common in code

0:04:40.960,0:04:46.400
to do something forever forever loops

0:04:43.680,0:04:46.400
are in control

0:04:46.880,0:04:50.880
and here's my forever loop that i'm

0:04:48.960,0:04:52.720
going to put on my fish

0:04:50.880,0:04:54.800
so a lot of these concepts are things

0:04:52.720,0:04:56.160
we've seen before we try to do this by

0:04:54.800,0:04:57.520
design and games where we have these

0:04:56.160,0:04:59.680
same concepts

0:04:57.520,0:05:01.199
over and over and you can kind of see

0:04:59.680,0:05:02.160
that there's a little bit of setup stuff

0:05:01.199,0:05:04.560
at the start

0:05:02.160,0:05:05.759
and then a loop that goes forever now

0:05:04.560,0:05:08.320
what i want to do forever

0:05:05.759,0:05:08.960
is my fish is always swimming so i'm

0:05:08.320,0:05:12.800
going to grab

0:05:08.960,0:05:15.680
a move and put it in here

0:05:12.800,0:05:17.120
right now it's move 10 steps that's

0:05:15.680,0:05:18.639
going to be a little too fast i'm going

0:05:17.120,0:05:22.479
to start him at 3

0:05:18.639,0:05:22.479
so move 3 steps

0:05:22.639,0:05:26.479
if i did run the game right now uh he

0:05:24.639,0:05:29.039
would start swimming in a straight line

0:05:26.479,0:05:30.400
which would be great um if i stopped the

0:05:29.039,0:05:32.240
game and i started again he would swim

0:05:30.400,0:05:34.560
in a straight line again

0:05:32.240,0:05:35.360
uh straight lines aren't much fun uh we

0:05:34.560,0:05:37.199
want to do something

0:05:35.360,0:05:38.400
different so i want the left arrow key

0:05:37.199,0:05:41.600
and the right arrow key

0:05:38.400,0:05:45.919
to let me change my direction so

0:05:41.600,0:05:45.919
we want if statements so go to control

0:05:46.400,0:05:53.840
and drag over two if statements so one

0:05:50.639,0:05:53.840
and then another

0:05:54.160,0:05:57.199
and what these if statements want to do

0:05:56.080,0:06:00.319
is they want to say

0:05:57.199,0:06:01.039
if somebody is pressing the left arrow

0:06:00.319,0:06:03.759
key

0:06:01.039,0:06:04.639
then we want to rotate left a little bit

0:06:03.759,0:06:06.080
then the other one's going to say if

0:06:04.639,0:06:08.000
somebody's pressing the right arrow key

0:06:06.080,0:06:10.639
we want to rotate right a little bit

0:06:08.000,0:06:12.319
so we'll do now we can do one together

0:06:10.639,0:06:15.120
then let's do the other

0:06:12.319,0:06:15.120
so sensing

0:06:16.240,0:06:20.080
if the key space is pressed i don't want

0:06:18.800,0:06:23.600
to switch space to be

0:06:20.080,0:06:24.960
left arrow so if the key left arrow is

0:06:23.600,0:06:28.000
pressed

0:06:24.960,0:06:29.039
then inside motion i want to do a left

0:06:28.000,0:06:32.000
turn

0:06:29.039,0:06:33.280
see if you can do the right turn and

0:06:32.000,0:06:35.280
then see if you can try it so right now

0:06:33.280,0:06:38.080
my fish can turn to the left

0:06:35.280,0:06:38.800
um but he really can't turn uh to the

0:06:38.080,0:06:40.319
right yet

0:06:38.800,0:06:42.639
so see if you can do that all by

0:06:40.319,0:06:44.720
yourself

0:06:42.639,0:06:45.680
all right so i added mine uh so now i

0:06:44.720,0:06:47.680
can go left

0:06:45.680,0:06:48.960
uh or i can go right and he can swim

0:06:47.680,0:06:51.919
around

0:06:48.960,0:06:52.639
now just for fun the speed right now is

0:06:51.919,0:06:55.039
always

0:06:52.639,0:06:55.919
three and you'll notice that we don't

0:06:55.039,0:06:58.000
need the up

0:06:55.919,0:06:59.759
uh or down arrows for this style of

0:06:58.000,0:07:00.479
motion so we're going to add a fun

0:06:59.759,0:07:02.479
feature

0:07:00.479,0:07:04.639
and learn a little bit about variables

0:07:02.479,0:07:05.199
so instead of the speed always being

0:07:04.639,0:07:07.039
three

0:07:05.199,0:07:09.520
let's make a variable so click on

0:07:07.039,0:07:12.880
variables

0:07:09.520,0:07:14.080
click on make a variable and we're going

0:07:12.880,0:07:17.520
to make a variable called

0:07:14.080,0:07:19.120
speed that's for this sprite only

0:07:17.520,0:07:21.039
so see how there's kind of two options

0:07:19.120,0:07:22.400
it can be for all sprites they all share

0:07:21.039,0:07:25.520
the variable

0:07:22.400,0:07:26.319
or the speed is for the sprite only so

0:07:25.520,0:07:30.080
speed

0:07:26.319,0:07:31.599
for this sprite only and hit okay now

0:07:30.080,0:07:33.759
whenever we make a variable there's

0:07:31.599,0:07:36.080
usually three things we need to do

0:07:33.759,0:07:36.960
we need to set its value initially so

0:07:36.080,0:07:40.639
i'm going to

0:07:36.960,0:07:43.440
drag a set uh into my like starting area

0:07:40.639,0:07:44.080
so notice how it's near the top and i'm

0:07:43.440,0:07:47.599
going to set the

0:07:44.080,0:07:50.240
speed to be three so we

0:07:47.599,0:07:51.840
we made the variable uh we set its

0:07:50.240,0:07:53.360
initial value

0:07:51.840,0:07:54.879
um and then we're going to use the

0:07:53.360,0:07:55.199
variable so i'm going to go ahead and

0:07:54.879,0:08:00.240
take

0:07:55.199,0:08:03.440
speed and drop it into move speed steps

0:08:00.240,0:08:04.400
so with that change it's the exact same

0:08:03.440,0:08:07.440
as it was before

0:08:04.400,0:08:08.879
no no no change at all yet right

0:08:07.440,0:08:11.199
but usually what we want to do with

0:08:08.879,0:08:13.120
variables is we want to create them

0:08:11.199,0:08:14.720
we want to initialize their value we

0:08:13.120,0:08:15.199
want to use them we also want to change

0:08:14.720,0:08:16.800
them

0:08:15.199,0:08:19.599
so let's go ahead and do this to change

0:08:16.800,0:08:23.919
it let's add two more if statements

0:08:19.599,0:08:25.919
i add an if statement for up arrow

0:08:23.919,0:08:27.840
and for down arrow so i'll go ahead and

0:08:25.919,0:08:32.240
do one of them with you

0:08:27.840,0:08:34.000
so if touching up arrow

0:08:32.240,0:08:38.000
well with up arrow we want the speed to

0:08:34.000,0:08:38.000
go up so i'm going to go to variables

0:08:38.479,0:08:42.080
and this time i'm going to say change

0:08:41.039,0:08:45.760
the variable so

0:08:42.080,0:08:47.120
change speed and i'm going to make it go

0:08:45.760,0:08:49.680
up by just a half

0:08:47.120,0:08:51.279
so i'm going to go up a half so this

0:08:49.680,0:08:54.320
will be kind of hard for you

0:08:51.279,0:08:56.000
but we've got the key up arrow makes it

0:08:54.320,0:08:58.240
go up by a half

0:08:56.000,0:08:59.680
how could down arrow make it go like

0:08:58.240,0:09:00.959
down by a half

0:08:59.680,0:09:02.880
so you're going to need a negative in

0:09:00.959,0:09:04.640
there see if you can do it all by

0:09:02.880,0:09:07.120
yourself

0:09:04.640,0:09:08.000
all right so i got mine added so i said

0:09:07.120,0:09:10.240
if down

0:09:08.000,0:09:11.279
arrow pressed then change speed by

0:09:10.240,0:09:12.720
negative 0.5

0:09:11.279,0:09:14.320
now let's review the code a little bit

0:09:12.720,0:09:15.920
before we move on because there's a lot

0:09:14.320,0:09:17.920
of little pieces here

0:09:15.920,0:09:19.279
so when green flag collect the two

0:09:17.920,0:09:20.959
motions i think we got that

0:09:19.279,0:09:22.959
here's what all we did was speed we set

0:09:20.959,0:09:24.720
it up to the top make sure it says speed

0:09:22.959,0:09:26.240
in your code not my variable

0:09:24.720,0:09:28.160
by the way sometimes i like to delete

0:09:26.240,0:09:29.920
that old nasty my variable

0:09:28.160,0:09:31.839
because it just causes me problems right

0:09:29.920,0:09:33.839
make sure it says speed speed

0:09:31.839,0:09:35.120
speed speed no my variables anywhere so

0:09:33.839,0:09:38.160
we set it

0:09:35.120,0:09:40.160
we use it and we modify it i think

0:09:38.160,0:09:42.720
mine's ready to go so now my fish

0:09:40.160,0:09:44.320
can swim around now my fish kind of

0:09:42.720,0:09:46.080
turns a little quick

0:09:44.320,0:09:47.200
if i wanted to i could change that but

0:09:46.080,0:09:48.240
i'm not worried about it the thing i

0:09:47.200,0:09:50.320
want to test here is

0:09:48.240,0:09:52.240
does my up arrow change my speed oh it

0:09:50.320,0:09:52.880
sure does so now i'm kind of zipping and

0:09:52.240,0:09:56.240
zooming

0:09:52.880,0:09:57.680
um i could also uh slow down so

0:09:56.240,0:09:59.279
uh it's interesting i can actually make

0:09:57.680,0:10:01.200
my fish to where he stops

0:09:59.279,0:10:02.560
which is kind of cool and then this is

0:10:01.200,0:10:04.959
not really realistic

0:10:02.560,0:10:06.399
but your fish can in fact swim backwards

0:10:04.959,0:10:08.320
right

0:10:06.399,0:10:11.839
that's fine right but it's a really good

0:10:08.320,0:10:11.839
example of variables

0:10:12.000,0:10:15.279
all right so let's go ahead and save our

0:10:14.399,0:10:20.480
game

0:10:15.279,0:10:22.720
i'm going to call mine fish lunch

0:10:20.480,0:10:24.560
um and i think we're ready to add our

0:10:22.720,0:10:26.000
next sprite

0:10:24.560,0:10:28.000
so the next sprite that we're going to

0:10:26.000,0:10:29.200
add is the uh actually let's put a

0:10:28.000,0:10:30.959
background on first i

0:10:29.200,0:10:33.920
my fish is swimming around in white

0:10:30.959,0:10:35.920
let's go ahead and choose a background

0:10:33.920,0:10:38.079
you can choose any background that's

0:10:35.920,0:10:40.800
appropriate for what you want

0:10:38.079,0:10:42.000
mine's a fish so mine's underwater so

0:10:40.800,0:10:44.000
you can see i've got two good

0:10:42.000,0:10:47.200
underwater options i'll just pick this

0:10:44.000,0:10:48.560
one so now i've got a background

0:10:47.200,0:10:50.640
and now what i really want to do is i

0:10:48.560,0:10:51.600
want to go see what my campers have

0:10:50.640,0:10:52.959
picked for their

0:10:51.600,0:10:54.480
uh because i'm sure that they did not

0:10:52.959,0:10:55.120
all pick fish right because they're all

0:10:54.480,0:10:57.120
crazy

0:10:55.120,0:10:58.560
uh what they picked for their fish what

0:10:57.120,0:11:00.000
they picked for the background

0:10:58.560,0:11:01.120
and things like that all right neela

0:11:00.000,0:11:02.320
what do you make what do you have going

0:11:01.120,0:11:05.360
on the party

0:11:02.320,0:11:06.079
where the care bears are trying to get

0:11:05.360,0:11:08.720
the units

0:11:06.079,0:11:10.480
so she made a party with a unicorn uh

0:11:08.720,0:11:12.240
and she's got a plan to have like

0:11:10.480,0:11:14.640
care bears in there bowen what did you

0:11:12.240,0:11:18.000
do i made a draco

0:11:14.640,0:11:20.399
a draco that's a type of gecko

0:11:18.000,0:11:21.680
make him fly around some yeah i'll make

0:11:20.399,0:11:24.160
it that's cool

0:11:21.680,0:11:25.440
so my campers uh have a few skills that

0:11:24.160,0:11:27.519
we're going to teach you today about how

0:11:25.440,0:11:28.800
to get things off the internet so draco

0:11:27.519,0:11:30.880
actually came from the internet we'll

0:11:28.800,0:11:32.720
teach you how to do that today

0:11:30.880,0:11:34.399
uh mckinley's got a dolphin swimming

0:11:32.720,0:11:36.240
around so she's also got an underwater

0:11:34.399,0:11:37.920
she's zipping and zooming

0:11:36.240,0:11:40.399
and then keegan what have you got today

0:11:37.920,0:11:41.120
minion uh he's got a minion so yeah so

0:11:40.399,0:11:42.640
he also

0:11:41.120,0:11:45.279
uh grabbed something from the internet

0:11:42.640,0:11:46.560
uh which we will show you uh today

0:11:45.279,0:11:49.839
all right so the next thing we want to

0:11:46.560,0:11:52.160
do is uh make a new sprite

0:11:49.839,0:11:53.600
this next sprite is going to be our food

0:11:52.160,0:11:56.480
so you can see that we've got the

0:11:53.600,0:11:58.079
the food over here the food what i want

0:11:56.480,0:11:58.959
you to do is i want you to practice

0:11:58.079,0:12:02.480
drawing

0:11:58.959,0:12:02.880
for a sprite so click on um or hover

0:12:02.480,0:12:05.200
over

0:12:02.880,0:12:06.720
sorry where it says choose a sprite and

0:12:05.200,0:12:07.200
in the past we've always just clicked it

0:12:06.720,0:12:09.120
right

0:12:07.200,0:12:10.800
well clicking it is actually the same as

0:12:09.120,0:12:11.440
choose a sprite right so it's the same

0:12:10.800,0:12:14.000
thing

0:12:11.440,0:12:16.160
but you can also paint a sprite or you

0:12:14.000,0:12:17.360
can upload an image of a sprite

0:12:16.160,0:12:19.200
this time what i want you to do for your

0:12:17.360,0:12:22.240
food is i want you to paint a sprite

0:12:19.200,0:12:25.279
so go ahead and click on paint

0:12:22.240,0:12:26.800
that will bring up the drawing canvas um

0:12:25.279,0:12:27.920
and what i want you to do is i want you

0:12:26.800,0:12:31.839
to draw

0:12:27.920,0:12:34.560
your food so for example uh my fish food

0:12:31.839,0:12:37.040
is just gonna be a few brown circles so

0:12:34.560,0:12:39.839
i'm gonna learn about the circle tool

0:12:37.040,0:12:41.839
so i set my color to a brown i can

0:12:39.839,0:12:44.160
decide if it has an outline or not

0:12:41.839,0:12:45.680
maybe i want a thin outline so maybe

0:12:44.160,0:12:48.160
i'll make like a really thin outline

0:12:45.680,0:12:49.360
um and i'll just draw a couple uh food

0:12:48.160,0:12:52.320
pellets right

0:12:49.360,0:12:53.839
so this is just kind of fish food you

0:12:52.320,0:12:56.880
can also do things with

0:12:53.839,0:12:59.360
with different colors if you want so i

0:12:56.880,0:13:02.240
can make some of them brown

0:12:59.360,0:13:03.060
or maybe i can make another one like a

0:13:02.240,0:13:04.639
darker green

0:13:03.060,0:13:05.839
[Music]

0:13:04.639,0:13:07.519
you can really just kind of draw

0:13:05.839,0:13:08.800
whatever you want there's there's no

0:13:07.519,0:13:11.680
right or wrong answer

0:13:08.800,0:13:13.440
uh to fish food right so feel free to

0:13:11.680,0:13:15.279
just play around a little bit

0:13:13.440,0:13:16.639
until you're happy with uh with your

0:13:15.279,0:13:18.000
food

0:13:16.639,0:13:19.680
don't worry about the size when you're

0:13:18.000,0:13:20.880
drawing because the size you'll take

0:13:19.680,0:13:23.519
care of

0:13:20.880,0:13:24.959
with the size that's over here so draw

0:13:23.519,0:13:28.480
it big

0:13:24.959,0:13:31.279
and then resize it over there so

0:13:28.480,0:13:34.000
go nuts until you're really happy with

0:13:31.279,0:13:36.160
your food sprites

0:13:34.000,0:13:38.560
all right so my camper's got their food

0:13:36.160,0:13:41.040
drawn some some some good food out there

0:13:38.560,0:13:42.320
let's go into the code for the food so

0:13:41.040,0:13:45.279
this is a sprite

0:13:42.320,0:13:46.959
so it's got code like most codes it's

0:13:45.279,0:13:49.839
going to start off with a win

0:13:46.959,0:13:51.920
green flag clicked it's a very common

0:13:49.839,0:13:53.360
thing to do

0:13:51.920,0:13:55.360
and then the next thing i like to do is

0:13:53.360,0:13:56.240
i like to set the starting position of

0:13:55.360,0:13:57.680
the food

0:13:56.240,0:13:59.600
but it's going to be a little different

0:13:57.680,0:14:02.639
i want it to be different every time

0:13:59.600,0:14:05.199
so i'm actually going to say go to

0:14:02.639,0:14:05.760
random position so you can try this a

0:14:05.199,0:14:07.040
couple times

0:14:05.760,0:14:09.440
when i hit the game start you can see

0:14:07.040,0:14:10.880
one time it showed up up here

0:14:09.440,0:14:13.760
and then i hit game start again it

0:14:10.880,0:14:15.839
showed up way way down there

0:14:13.760,0:14:17.120
and every time you play your game the

0:14:15.839,0:14:18.959
food will start

0:14:17.120,0:14:20.639
somewhere different which is kind of the

0:14:18.959,0:14:22.399
goal

0:14:20.639,0:14:24.240
by the way if this fish speed is in your

0:14:22.399,0:14:25.760
way you can

0:14:24.240,0:14:28.160
you can move it to somewhere different

0:14:25.760,0:14:29.920
if you want so like maybe like jam it

0:14:28.160,0:14:32.240
way up over here

0:14:29.920,0:14:33.440
you could also change its readout so you

0:14:32.240,0:14:35.440
can make it like a

0:14:33.440,0:14:37.120
number readout if you wanted so you

0:14:35.440,0:14:38.720
right click on it

0:14:37.120,0:14:40.240
or you could change it to a slider

0:14:38.720,0:14:41.519
readout

0:14:40.240,0:14:43.360
or you could change it to just the

0:14:41.519,0:14:44.800
normal readout just letting you know

0:14:43.360,0:14:45.279
that you can kind of move those around a

0:14:44.800,0:14:47.360
little bit

0:14:45.279,0:14:48.399
i'm going to jam mine in the upper right

0:14:47.360,0:14:50.560
hand corner

0:14:48.399,0:14:51.920
just to kind of get it out of the way

0:14:50.560,0:14:53.519
all right so right now

0:14:51.920,0:14:55.199
your food shows up in a random spot but

0:14:53.519,0:14:57.600
when you eat the food

0:14:55.199,0:14:58.720
nothing happens right so i want to fix

0:14:57.600,0:15:02.000
that

0:14:58.720,0:15:04.320
so i want my food to forever

0:15:02.000,0:15:05.680
be sensing for the fish so the food is

0:15:04.320,0:15:06.480
going to check to see if the fish

0:15:05.680,0:15:08.079
touches it

0:15:06.480,0:15:10.320
so i got to do it forever so the first

0:15:08.079,0:15:13.120
thing is i go to control

0:15:10.320,0:15:14.720
or add a forever loop one mistake people

0:15:13.120,0:15:15.920
sometimes make is they add on an if

0:15:14.720,0:15:17.040
statement right now

0:15:15.920,0:15:19.199
and that would be bad because it would

0:15:17.040,0:15:19.680
just check one time and then never never

0:15:19.199,0:15:21.519
again

0:15:19.680,0:15:23.519
we want to forever check right so i'm

0:15:21.519,0:15:26.639
going to say forever

0:15:23.519,0:15:28.639
and then i'm going to do if and then i

0:15:26.639,0:15:31.600
want to sense if i'm touching the fish

0:15:28.639,0:15:32.480
so the if part is going to be in sensing

0:15:31.600,0:15:36.079
i'm going to say

0:15:32.480,0:15:37.600
touching mouse pointer

0:15:36.079,0:15:39.519
now obviously i don't want the mouse

0:15:37.600,0:15:41.759
pointer but that's why that white

0:15:39.519,0:15:42.560
drop down is on there so i hit the white

0:15:41.759,0:15:45.519
drop down

0:15:42.560,0:15:46.079
and now you can select the name of your

0:15:45.519,0:15:48.720
sprite

0:15:46.079,0:15:51.279
so in this case in my case it's the fish

0:15:48.720,0:15:54.639
so if i'm touching the fish

0:15:51.279,0:15:55.920
what happens so um i like sounds

0:15:54.639,0:15:58.079
so i'm probably going to make some kind

0:15:55.920,0:15:58.800
of sound i'm going to see what kind of

0:15:58.079,0:16:00.399
sounds

0:15:58.800,0:16:02.160
this thing has by default it's got it

0:16:00.399,0:16:04.639
it's got a pop sound

0:16:02.160,0:16:05.759
pop is okay i could use pop but if you

0:16:04.639,0:16:08.480
want to make a different sound just

0:16:05.759,0:16:11.600
click on this choose a sound down here

0:16:08.480,0:16:14.320
and i always like chomp

0:16:11.600,0:16:15.839
so now i can play a pop sound or i can

0:16:14.320,0:16:17.440
play a chop sound

0:16:15.839,0:16:19.120
so now i've got those kind of like in my

0:16:17.440,0:16:21.040
library i go back to the codes you can

0:16:19.120,0:16:22.959
easily switch to sounds

0:16:21.040,0:16:25.600
or you can go back to code and in code

0:16:22.959,0:16:28.800
what i want to do is i want to go sound

0:16:25.600,0:16:29.279
and i want to put on a play or sorry

0:16:28.800,0:16:32.240
start

0:16:29.279,0:16:32.959
sound chomp note that there's two

0:16:32.240,0:16:35.199
versions

0:16:32.959,0:16:36.000
there's start the sound which means just

0:16:35.199,0:16:38.240
play it real quick

0:16:36.000,0:16:39.199
and keep moving or there's play until

0:16:38.240,0:16:41.920
done

0:16:39.199,0:16:43.120
in this case i want to just start it

0:16:41.920,0:16:45.120
because i want to immediately do

0:16:43.120,0:16:46.720
something else

0:16:45.120,0:16:48.800
the next thing i want to do is i want to

0:16:46.720,0:16:50.000
give them a point so we're going to keep

0:16:48.800,0:16:51.519
a score

0:16:50.000,0:16:53.680
and so we're going to need a variable

0:16:51.519,0:16:54.720
for score so i've got to make another

0:16:53.680,0:16:57.759
variable

0:16:54.720,0:16:58.880
so go to variables or like old pros at

0:16:57.759,0:17:00.720
variables

0:16:58.880,0:17:01.920
you'll notice that this sprite has no

0:17:00.720,0:17:05.839
variables

0:17:01.920,0:17:05.839
so go and click on make a variable

0:17:08.319,0:17:12.799
i'm going to call this variable score

0:17:11.199,0:17:15.199
now the score variable

0:17:12.799,0:17:17.520
is global right so everybody uses score

0:17:15.199,0:17:19.199
the fish increments the score

0:17:17.520,0:17:21.520
other people see the score the score is

0:17:19.199,0:17:25.039
for all sprites so that's global

0:17:21.520,0:17:27.360
so i'm going to hit ok so now he's got a

0:17:25.039,0:17:29.440
score variable

0:17:27.360,0:17:30.559
somewhere we've got to initialize it to

0:17:29.440,0:17:32.160
zero

0:17:30.559,0:17:34.400
we could do it we could do this on

0:17:32.160,0:17:36.000
either place we could do it on the fish

0:17:34.400,0:17:38.559
or we could do it on the food

0:17:36.000,0:17:40.720
doesn't matter um since i'm currently

0:17:38.559,0:17:43.360
looking at the code for the for the

0:17:40.720,0:17:45.280
food um i put it on the food so i set

0:17:43.360,0:17:47.440
the score to zero to start

0:17:45.280,0:17:49.120
so the same pattern so we made it we

0:17:47.440,0:17:50.640
initialized a value

0:17:49.120,0:17:52.559
the next thing we want to do is we want

0:17:50.640,0:17:55.919
to change it

0:17:52.559,0:18:01.200
so inside the if statement

0:17:55.919,0:18:03.200
put a change score by 1.

0:18:01.200,0:18:05.200
and then the last thing we want to do is

0:18:03.200,0:18:07.760
we want to move our food

0:18:05.200,0:18:08.559
to a different spot so they they score a

0:18:07.760,0:18:12.880
point

0:18:08.559,0:18:17.600
and then it moves on you so go to motion

0:18:12.880,0:18:17.600
and find go to random position

0:18:19.600,0:18:24.000
so you can see that it starts at zero it

0:18:22.559,0:18:27.039
goes to random position

0:18:24.000,0:18:29.679
if the fish touches it i make the sound

0:18:27.039,0:18:30.559
i change the score and i go somewhere

0:18:29.679,0:18:33.440
new

0:18:30.559,0:18:35.919
let's try it so i run my code so now

0:18:33.440,0:18:39.120
whenever i get my food

0:18:35.919,0:18:41.520
it makes a chomp i score a point

0:18:39.120,0:18:42.559
and it goes somewhere new now since

0:18:41.520,0:18:44.080
there's no enemies

0:18:42.559,0:18:46.799
the game's pretty easy right so i can

0:18:44.080,0:18:50.559
just go pretty fast with my fish

0:18:46.799,0:18:50.559
and i can just chomp things away wow

0:18:51.840,0:18:56.400
now with no enemies you can do this

0:18:54.559,0:18:58.640
until you get bored

0:18:56.400,0:18:59.840
but eventually you will get tired of

0:18:58.640,0:19:02.240
collecting food

0:18:59.840,0:19:03.679
because it's a little bit too easy right

0:19:02.240,0:19:05.840
i mean it's still fun

0:19:03.679,0:19:06.799
but it's but it's a little bit too easy

0:19:05.840,0:19:07.840
all right i'm going to see how my

0:19:06.799,0:19:10.080
campers are doing

0:19:07.840,0:19:11.760
i want to get them caught up uh show us

0:19:10.080,0:19:16.160
what you've got so far

0:19:11.760,0:19:20.640
so this is nila's so she's got a unicorn

0:19:16.160,0:19:23.679
um and then she's got a um

0:19:20.640,0:19:25.620
rainbow that she's uh she's collecting

0:19:23.679,0:19:26.960
cool so fun fun theme nila

0:19:25.620,0:19:29.440
[Music]

0:19:26.960,0:19:31.440
let's see what bowen's got oh bowen did

0:19:29.440,0:19:35.039
a great job with drawing

0:19:31.440,0:19:37.679
uh he drew a little fly um and he's got

0:19:35.039,0:19:40.720
his draco lizard that's flying around

0:19:37.679,0:19:40.720
why can't i catch you

0:19:41.039,0:19:45.039
oh it's close uh and bow and your score

0:19:43.600,0:19:46.720
isn't incrementing yet but we'll fix

0:19:45.039,0:19:49.200
that easy peasy okay buddy

0:19:46.720,0:19:50.240
okay uh let's have [ __ ] let's see what

0:19:49.200,0:19:53.840
you've got

0:19:50.240,0:19:56.400
so you've got uh a dolphin uh eating uh

0:19:53.840,0:19:57.280
a little tuna fish right uh-huh or like

0:19:56.400,0:19:59.120
a goldfish

0:19:57.280,0:20:01.360
you did a nice job a little like orange

0:19:59.120,0:20:04.240
goldfish nice

0:20:01.360,0:20:04.960
keegan what's your theme uh you've got a

0:20:04.240,0:20:07.679
minion

0:20:04.960,0:20:09.200
uh eating a banana that's a pretty

0:20:07.679,0:20:10.640
impressively drawn banana i'm

0:20:09.200,0:20:11.120
questioning whether you drew it all or

0:20:10.640,0:20:14.400
not

0:20:11.120,0:20:17.360
uh but it looks uh it looks great cool

0:20:14.400,0:20:19.520
super progress you guys all right i

0:20:17.360,0:20:21.120
think we are ready for some enemies

0:20:19.520,0:20:23.600
because our game is too easy

0:20:21.120,0:20:25.360
so i'm going to add one enemy that's

0:20:23.600,0:20:26.799
like from the the library

0:20:25.360,0:20:28.400
so we've kind of discovered that you can

0:20:26.799,0:20:29.840
either just click on the circle or you

0:20:28.400,0:20:31.679
can click on this magnifying glass it's

0:20:29.840,0:20:35.440
the same button right

0:20:31.679,0:20:37.840
and what mine is is my game is a fish

0:20:35.440,0:20:39.120
and so i'm going to add a shark now you

0:20:37.840,0:20:40.240
can see that there's a couple different

0:20:39.120,0:20:42.320
sharks here

0:20:40.240,0:20:44.240
this one is like either a hammerhead

0:20:42.320,0:20:46.159
shark or regular shark

0:20:44.240,0:20:48.080
and then this shark actually has like an

0:20:46.159,0:20:51.280
animation i'm going to add

0:20:48.080,0:20:53.520
this shark as you can see it switched

0:20:51.280,0:20:55.280
over to his code which we have none

0:20:53.520,0:20:56.720
no big surprise we're going to start

0:20:55.280,0:21:00.559
with the event

0:20:56.720,0:21:00.559
when green flag clips

0:21:00.640,0:21:04.000
the next thing that i like to do is i

0:21:02.240,0:21:06.320
like to set his starting position

0:21:04.000,0:21:07.679
and his starting direction um oh by the

0:21:06.320,0:21:09.600
way he's a little big so i'm going to

0:21:07.679,0:21:11.280
move him to where i want him

0:21:09.600,0:21:13.200
i'm going to adjust his size if

0:21:11.280,0:21:15.039
necessary

0:21:13.200,0:21:16.640
and so i'm going to have my shark always

0:21:15.039,0:21:18.320
start from right here

0:21:16.640,0:21:20.480
so if i want to always start from right

0:21:18.320,0:21:24.799
there i go to motion

0:21:20.480,0:21:27.440
and i drag over a go to xy

0:21:24.799,0:21:29.360
again as long as you've set him there

0:21:27.440,0:21:30.640
those numbers will just be correct

0:21:29.360,0:21:33.120
right that's one thing that i love about

0:21:30.640,0:21:35.200
scratch the next thing we're going to do

0:21:33.120,0:21:38.559
is we're going to decide what direction

0:21:35.200,0:21:40.960
that he should point in so he's going to

0:21:38.559,0:21:44.159
just continually move in a line

0:21:40.960,0:21:45.520
in some direction now if we ran this

0:21:44.159,0:21:47.840
game right now

0:21:45.520,0:21:49.280
he would be pointing to the right and

0:21:47.840,0:21:50.240
eventually he's going to move he's not

0:21:49.280,0:21:51.840
moving yet

0:21:50.240,0:21:54.400
let's go and make a move so let's go

0:21:51.840,0:21:58.159
control

0:21:54.400,0:22:01.039
forever and then in motion we're going

0:21:58.159,0:22:01.039
to make him move

0:22:01.600,0:22:07.840
and then this is a fun trick

0:22:04.720,0:22:10.840
inside movement there's a very special

0:22:07.840,0:22:13.020
type of movement it says if on edge

0:22:10.840,0:22:14.559
bounce this is kind of fun

0:22:13.020,0:22:17.840
[Music]

0:22:14.559,0:22:18.640
if on edge bounce so right now if you

0:22:17.840,0:22:20.320
run him

0:22:18.640,0:22:22.559
he's going to point to the right and

0:22:20.320,0:22:24.840
he's just going to go back and forth

0:22:22.559,0:22:27.280
the whole time which is kind of neat

0:22:24.840,0:22:29.520
right

0:22:27.280,0:22:30.559
now that's good i'm happy about how

0:22:29.520,0:22:32.240
things are going

0:22:30.559,0:22:34.240
but i don't want him to always go to the

0:22:32.240,0:22:36.320
right i could set a different direction

0:22:34.240,0:22:37.760
for him but i want him to go in a random

0:22:36.320,0:22:39.280
direction every time

0:22:37.760,0:22:41.760
so here's what we're going to do instead

0:22:39.280,0:22:44.880
of saying point in direction 90

0:22:41.760,0:22:47.760
i'm going to go to operators and i'm

0:22:44.880,0:22:49.360
going to pick a random number

0:22:47.760,0:22:51.679
so i'm going to drag over this pick

0:22:49.360,0:22:52.159
random and i'm going to put it right

0:22:51.679,0:22:55.280
here

0:22:52.159,0:22:56.960
on point in direction

0:22:55.280,0:22:58.799
uh now this seems like a math lesson

0:22:56.960,0:23:02.159
opportunity right now it says

0:22:58.799,0:23:03.280
one degree to 10 degrees if i want all

0:23:02.159,0:23:05.280
the different options

0:23:03.280,0:23:06.320
so like not just one but all the

0:23:05.280,0:23:07.280
different options so you can start in

0:23:06.320,0:23:08.960
any direction

0:23:07.280,0:23:10.559
what number do i need to put here

0:23:08.960,0:23:12.000
campers this might be a question for

0:23:10.559,0:23:13.000
keegan keegan what's all the way around

0:23:12.000,0:23:16.320
the circle

0:23:13.000,0:23:16.919
108 not 180 different number double that

0:23:16.320,0:23:20.480
much

0:23:16.919,0:23:23.919
360. 360. neil i got it

0:23:20.480,0:23:26.320
way to go neela so now if i run it uh

0:23:23.919,0:23:27.840
one time he picked that direction uh and

0:23:26.320,0:23:29.360
then another time he picked a different

0:23:27.840,0:23:31.200
direction but this gives him a

0:23:29.360,0:23:32.640
a little bit of randomness right so

0:23:31.200,0:23:34.720
every time you do it

0:23:32.640,0:23:36.080
he goes in a different direction all

0:23:34.720,0:23:38.480
right next thing i want to do

0:23:36.080,0:23:40.640
is if i hit the fish um something should

0:23:38.480,0:23:43.200
happen right so like if i hit the fish

0:23:40.640,0:23:44.559
um the the game should end right so i

0:23:43.200,0:23:47.679
need an if statement

0:23:44.559,0:23:47.679
so i'm going to go into control

0:23:47.919,0:23:51.840
i'm going to take an if statement here

0:23:52.559,0:23:57.679
and what i want to do is i want to sense

0:23:55.600,0:24:00.880
whether i'm touching the fish or not so

0:23:57.679,0:24:00.880
i'm going to say touching

0:24:02.840,0:24:07.440
fish

0:24:04.960,0:24:09.360
so if i'm touching the fish i want

0:24:07.440,0:24:10.960
something to happen

0:24:09.360,0:24:12.559
in this particular case we're going to

0:24:10.960,0:24:15.200
make something interesting happen

0:24:12.559,0:24:17.039
we're going to broadcast an event that

0:24:15.200,0:24:18.720
we've hit the fish

0:24:17.039,0:24:20.640
broadcasting events is something new

0:24:18.720,0:24:22.000
it's something we've never seen before

0:24:20.640,0:24:24.559
but if i hit the fish i'm going to

0:24:22.000,0:24:26.960
scream to everybody i hit the fish

0:24:24.559,0:24:28.400
um and then everybody can respond to it

0:24:26.960,0:24:31.120
that's that way we know

0:24:28.400,0:24:32.000
so events are actually well sorry

0:24:31.120,0:24:34.400
they're in the events

0:24:32.000,0:24:35.760
area and so i want to broadcast this

0:24:34.400,0:24:39.760
event so find where it says

0:24:35.760,0:24:42.799
broadcast message one and stick that

0:24:39.760,0:24:44.840
inside of here and what i want to do

0:24:42.799,0:24:46.320
here is i want to say instead of message

0:24:44.840,0:24:49.600
one

0:24:46.320,0:24:52.400
i want to broadcast a new message

0:24:49.600,0:24:55.039
and i'm going to broadcast a message

0:24:52.400,0:24:55.039
called hit

0:24:56.960,0:25:00.320
so it's kind of crazy i don't do

0:24:58.640,0:25:02.480
anything at all inside of here

0:25:00.320,0:25:03.520
i just scream to everybody i hit the

0:25:02.480,0:25:05.600
fish

0:25:03.520,0:25:06.559
and then everybody can respond to it

0:25:05.600,0:25:08.559
including me

0:25:06.559,0:25:09.760
right so including me i can respond to

0:25:08.559,0:25:11.360
this event

0:25:09.760,0:25:12.960
all right so what we want to do is we

0:25:11.360,0:25:16.240
want to

0:25:12.960,0:25:16.960
find a event that says like when i

0:25:16.240,0:25:19.600
receive

0:25:16.960,0:25:20.799
hit uh and so it's right here when i

0:25:19.600,0:25:22.720
receive

0:25:20.799,0:25:24.240
and you can see it says uh message one

0:25:22.720,0:25:27.039
i'm gonna switch that to hit

0:25:24.240,0:25:28.080
so everybody is gonna listen for this

0:25:27.039,0:25:29.520
event

0:25:28.080,0:25:31.120
and it's really no different than the

0:25:29.520,0:25:32.720
green flag event so the green flag is

0:25:31.120,0:25:35.360
when they press the green flag

0:25:32.720,0:25:37.200
and this is when the event hit occurs so

0:25:35.360,0:25:39.200
what do i want to do

0:25:37.200,0:25:41.279
when a hit occurs well the first thing i

0:25:39.200,0:25:43.760
want to do is i want to stop

0:25:41.279,0:25:44.799
my other script right so i want to stop

0:25:43.760,0:25:48.080
moving

0:25:44.799,0:25:49.440
so that's in control and this is kind of

0:25:48.080,0:25:52.720
confusing but it's

0:25:49.440,0:25:54.320
it's stop all but notice how this all

0:25:52.720,0:25:55.520
has a white arrow so you know you can

0:25:54.320,0:25:58.880
change it

0:25:55.520,0:26:00.480
i want to stop the other scripts so

0:25:58.880,0:26:02.640
the first thing that happens whenever

0:26:00.480,0:26:03.919
somebody hits whether it's this fish or

0:26:02.640,0:26:06.799
somebody else

0:26:03.919,0:26:08.799
we stop the other script so we're no

0:26:06.799,0:26:09.840
longer running that script anymore it's

0:26:08.799,0:26:11.760
done

0:26:09.840,0:26:13.440
now the only thing that happens is my

0:26:11.760,0:26:16.000
code here

0:26:13.440,0:26:17.120
just for fun what i want to do is i want

0:26:16.000,0:26:20.799
to glide

0:26:17.120,0:26:22.080
to the bottom so i try this this is

0:26:20.799,0:26:26.559
going to be something new for us

0:26:22.080,0:26:26.559
find the glide that has the x and the y

0:26:27.600,0:26:31.919
now gliding to the bottom uh the y is

0:26:30.640,0:26:36.000
like negative

0:26:31.919,0:26:38.960
180 i think that's the very bottom

0:26:36.000,0:26:41.039
and the x i don't want to move my

0:26:38.960,0:26:42.799
current x so wherever i hit the fish at

0:26:41.039,0:26:44.400
from that point i want to glide to the

0:26:42.799,0:26:45.840
bottom so the x

0:26:44.400,0:26:47.840
we actually there's no number we could

0:26:45.840,0:26:49.120
type in there instead we want the

0:26:47.840,0:26:52.080
variable that's called

0:26:49.120,0:26:54.480
x position so basically that means don't

0:26:52.080,0:26:57.600
change my x

0:26:54.480,0:26:58.400
so from wherever i'm at i want to glide

0:26:57.600,0:27:01.039
to the bottom

0:26:58.400,0:27:02.320
straight down which is at negative 180

0:27:01.039,0:27:03.600
in the y and i want to keep my x

0:27:02.320,0:27:05.360
position the same

0:27:03.600,0:27:07.930
you can decide how long to do that i'm

0:27:05.360,0:27:10.559
going to do it over two seconds

0:27:07.930,0:27:13.520
[Music]

0:27:10.559,0:27:16.080
so we're going to try our code now we

0:27:13.520,0:27:18.000
are broadcasting this hit message

0:27:16.080,0:27:19.840
but the only person so far that's

0:27:18.000,0:27:21.440
listening is

0:27:19.840,0:27:22.070
just the shark so i'm going to go and

0:27:21.440,0:27:23.520
hit play

0:27:22.070,0:27:25.679
[Music]

0:27:23.520,0:27:26.559
by the way my shark is way too fast i'll

0:27:25.679,0:27:29.440
fix that

0:27:26.559,0:27:30.960
and so you can see that once um once i

0:27:29.440,0:27:34.559
hit the shark

0:27:30.960,0:27:36.640
he does that fall to the bottom right

0:27:34.559,0:27:37.600
now other people should also listen to

0:27:36.640,0:27:39.919
this message

0:27:37.600,0:27:40.720
right so when i hit him he falls to the

0:27:39.919,0:27:44.159
bottom

0:27:40.720,0:27:46.640
all right so it's kind of silly for the

0:27:44.159,0:27:48.000
enemy to die but the fish to keep right

0:27:46.640,0:27:51.120
on swimming so let's have

0:27:48.000,0:27:54.399
the fish also respond to this head event

0:27:51.120,0:27:55.760
so come over to the fish's code and now

0:27:54.399,0:27:57.200
what we want to do with the fish is we

0:27:55.760,0:27:59.039
want to do the same thing we're going to

0:27:57.200,0:28:01.760
go to events

0:27:59.039,0:28:04.240
and he also is going to respond to the

0:28:01.760,0:28:07.039
hit event so when i receive hit

0:28:04.240,0:28:08.399
i'm going to do some things as well the

0:28:07.039,0:28:10.799
first thing i want to do

0:28:08.399,0:28:12.080
is i want to stop that other script that

0:28:10.799,0:28:13.039
was what was moving me around i want to

0:28:12.080,0:28:15.440
stop it

0:28:13.039,0:28:17.440
that's in control it's nor the very

0:28:15.440,0:28:18.799
bottom

0:28:17.440,0:28:21.039
i think this is confusing it's the one

0:28:18.799,0:28:22.720
that says stop all we don't want to stop

0:28:21.039,0:28:25.760
all not yet at least

0:28:22.720,0:28:26.559
but we want to stop other scripts in

0:28:25.760,0:28:28.880
this sprite

0:28:26.559,0:28:30.320
so i want to stop all the other scripts

0:28:28.880,0:28:32.080
so that's this script right here we're

0:28:30.320,0:28:34.000
going to stop doing it

0:28:32.080,0:28:35.360
and then we're going to make a sound

0:28:34.000,0:28:38.080
we're going to say like

0:28:35.360,0:28:40.000
game over or something like that now

0:28:38.080,0:28:42.880
normally what we do with sounds

0:28:40.000,0:28:43.840
is we go into the sound area and we pick

0:28:42.880,0:28:45.200
a sound

0:28:43.840,0:28:46.880
but you'll notice that there's different

0:28:45.200,0:28:47.440
options here too you can you can choose

0:28:46.880,0:28:49.039
the sound

0:28:47.440,0:28:50.960
just like you could choose uh sprite

0:28:49.039,0:28:53.600
images or you could

0:28:50.960,0:28:54.640
select a sound from your computer um or

0:28:53.600,0:28:54.960
this is the one we're going to do this

0:28:54.640,0:28:57.039
time

0:28:54.960,0:28:58.240
you could record a sound so we're going

0:28:57.039,0:29:01.679
to record a sound

0:28:58.240,0:29:02.720
so click on record it should ask you on

0:29:01.679,0:29:04.159
your computer

0:29:02.720,0:29:06.080
if you want to allow your microphone to

0:29:04.159,0:29:07.360
be used you have to say yes to that

0:29:06.080,0:29:10.240
and then you're going to click on record

0:29:07.360,0:29:12.399
here game over

0:29:10.240,0:29:13.279
so i recorded myself saying game over

0:29:12.399,0:29:16.159
once uh

0:29:13.279,0:29:17.279
you make a sound you can trim uh these

0:29:16.159,0:29:18.720
sides

0:29:17.279,0:29:22.559
uh such that it kind of like matches

0:29:18.720,0:29:24.240
your sound and then you can save it

0:29:22.559,0:29:25.679
you can name it if you want that's

0:29:24.240,0:29:26.000
optional i'm going to choose to name

0:29:25.679,0:29:29.440
mine

0:29:26.000,0:29:30.000
game over and then you can go back into

0:29:29.440,0:29:31.760
the code

0:29:30.000,0:29:34.320
and now you can use this sound just like

0:29:31.760,0:29:37.760
any other sound so i'm going to

0:29:34.320,0:29:37.760
start sound game over

0:29:38.000,0:29:40.799
and i'm going to play it now and see if

0:29:39.200,0:29:42.640
it works so whenever i hit my shark

0:29:40.799,0:29:45.360
who's still moving too fast

0:29:42.640,0:29:46.159
uh where yeah sure it should say game

0:29:45.360,0:29:48.640
over

0:29:46.159,0:29:49.760
so see if you can record your sound and

0:29:48.640,0:29:51.919
get it to say

0:29:49.760,0:29:55.840
game over or whatever you'd like

0:29:51.919,0:29:55.840
whenever your fish hits an enemy

0:29:56.159,0:30:00.159
all right so it says a message uh when

0:29:58.640,0:30:00.880
you when you lose the game says your

0:30:00.159,0:30:02.960
game over

0:30:00.880,0:30:04.880
let's also have it say something uh to

0:30:02.960,0:30:06.799
put your score on the screen

0:30:04.880,0:30:08.960
so to say something like in a speech

0:30:06.799,0:30:10.240
bubble that's in looks

0:30:08.960,0:30:14.480
and so we're going to grab the one that

0:30:10.240,0:30:14.480
says say hello for two seconds

0:30:15.120,0:30:17.679
now i'm going to zoom in a little bit

0:30:16.399,0:30:19.440
here so you can see what i'm about to do

0:30:17.679,0:30:23.600
now instead of saying hello

0:30:19.440,0:30:27.039
i want to say like you know great job

0:30:23.600,0:30:28.640
and then your score uh colon

0:30:27.039,0:30:31.760
so i want to tell them what their score

0:30:28.640,0:30:33.600
is now we did this last time too

0:30:31.760,0:30:34.799
if you want to like put two strings

0:30:33.600,0:30:37.840
together it's called

0:30:34.799,0:30:41.200
join and it's over in operators so i

0:30:37.840,0:30:42.880
want to find the one that says join

0:30:41.200,0:30:44.880
i'm going to put it in here on what i

0:30:42.880,0:30:46.720
typed was a loss there

0:30:44.880,0:30:48.080
so now i'm going to type it again great

0:30:46.720,0:30:52.080
job

0:30:48.080,0:30:55.520
score colon and then in variables

0:30:52.080,0:30:58.159
i'm going to drag over the score

0:30:55.520,0:30:59.840
so now when you finish the game so that

0:30:58.159,0:31:03.120
i got one point

0:30:59.840,0:31:04.720
it says great job score one

0:31:03.120,0:31:06.240
mine looked pretty good i want to say it

0:31:04.720,0:31:06.720
for a little longer i'm going to say it

0:31:06.240,0:31:08.320
for

0:31:06.720,0:31:10.640
five seconds just so they can kind of

0:31:08.320,0:31:12.880
see their score i'm going to go help my

0:31:10.640,0:31:14.480
campers type this but before i do

0:31:12.880,0:31:16.240
the last thing we're going to add on to

0:31:14.480,0:31:20.159
this script is

0:31:16.240,0:31:22.240
stop all so when the game is truly over

0:31:20.159,0:31:23.679
um it's nice to put a stop all in there

0:31:22.240,0:31:24.799
because you can see my green flag is

0:31:23.679,0:31:26.240
still like pressed down

0:31:24.799,0:31:27.840
that's because i didn't have that stop

0:31:26.240,0:31:28.159
all on there so i'm gonna do it one more

0:31:27.840,0:31:30.799
time

0:31:28.159,0:31:31.679
then i'm gonna help my campers so says

0:31:30.799,0:31:34.880
great job score

0:31:31.679,0:31:37.360
zero um and then it actually says um

0:31:34.880,0:31:37.919
stop all after five seconds four seconds

0:31:37.360,0:31:39.840
is probably

0:31:37.919,0:31:42.080
funny i'm gonna go help my campers type

0:31:39.840,0:31:43.600
some all right so i got mine tight for

0:31:42.080,0:31:45.279
everybody so we're doing pretty good the

0:31:43.600,0:31:47.519
only thing i want to change is i want to

0:31:45.279,0:31:49.360
change the speed of the enemy

0:31:47.519,0:31:51.919
and i also want to change the number of

0:31:49.360,0:31:53.360
enemies let's go play with his speed

0:31:51.919,0:31:55.600
now what i want to do is i want the game

0:31:53.360,0:31:57.039
to get progressively harder

0:31:55.600,0:31:59.919
so i'm going to go into my enemy over

0:31:57.039,0:32:00.960
here and i'm going to make a variable

0:31:59.919,0:32:04.960
and i'm going to call it

0:32:00.960,0:32:06.399
enemy speed so enemy speed is going to

0:32:04.960,0:32:07.760
be shared by all the enemies there's

0:32:06.399,0:32:08.480
eventually going to be a few different

0:32:07.760,0:32:12.240
enemies

0:32:08.480,0:32:15.120
so it's going to be for all sprites

0:32:12.240,0:32:17.360
so we created it like we normally do

0:32:15.120,0:32:20.000
we're going to set its value

0:32:17.360,0:32:21.200
we could set its value over in the fish

0:32:20.000,0:32:22.799
we could set it in the food

0:32:21.200,0:32:24.480
doesn't matter i'm going to set it right

0:32:22.799,0:32:28.240
here on my enemy code and i'm going to

0:32:24.480,0:32:30.720
set it to 10 to start with

0:32:28.240,0:32:31.440
and then i'm going to use enemy speed

0:32:30.720,0:32:34.000
where it says

0:32:31.440,0:32:34.000
move 10

0:32:35.039,0:32:38.240
and so now my speed is going to be

0:32:36.720,0:32:39.840
variable

0:32:38.240,0:32:41.519
i'm going to take my enemy speed and i'm

0:32:39.840,0:32:42.960
going to kind of put it up over here

0:32:41.519,0:32:45.519
by the other speed just to kind of like

0:32:42.960,0:32:48.880
smoosh them together

0:32:45.519,0:32:51.039
and so this speed can get increased

0:32:48.880,0:32:53.200
other places in the code so what i'm

0:32:51.039,0:32:54.559
going to do is i'm going to increase the

0:32:53.200,0:32:55.840
speed

0:32:54.559,0:32:58.159
other places in the code i'm going to

0:32:55.840,0:32:59.840
increase it over where food is at

0:32:58.159,0:33:01.919
so this is a neat interaction of things

0:32:59.840,0:33:04.559
so if i go over to food

0:33:01.919,0:33:06.399
food has totally different code food

0:33:04.559,0:33:08.399
increases the score

0:33:06.399,0:33:10.240
he's also going to change the enemy

0:33:08.399,0:33:14.240
speed so grab a change

0:33:10.240,0:33:16.080
enemy speed and put it right in here

0:33:14.240,0:33:18.159
and he's gonna bump up the enemy speed

0:33:16.080,0:33:20.159
by two

0:33:18.159,0:33:21.919
now i know it looks like the speed's

0:33:20.159,0:33:22.559
already too fast we're making it faster

0:33:21.919,0:33:25.039
that's coming

0:33:22.559,0:33:26.640
bear with me but it's kind of the same

0:33:25.039,0:33:27.519
pattern we did before we created the

0:33:26.640,0:33:30.640
variable

0:33:27.519,0:33:31.919
we initialized the variable we modified

0:33:30.640,0:33:34.399
it in a different sprite

0:33:31.919,0:33:35.919
that's fine and then we used it in this

0:33:34.399,0:33:37.200
sprite now what i'm going to do to slow

0:33:35.919,0:33:39.039
it down is i'm actually going to go to

0:33:37.200,0:33:42.519
control

0:33:39.039,0:33:45.679
and i'm going to add a weight of

0:33:42.519,0:33:48.320
0.1 seconds

0:33:45.679,0:33:49.840
and the reason i'm adding this delay is

0:33:48.320,0:33:51.679
that my sprite

0:33:49.840,0:33:52.799
has costumes that he can go through so

0:33:51.679,0:33:54.080
he can kind of like go through this

0:33:52.799,0:33:56.159
animation

0:33:54.080,0:33:57.200
so what i'm going to do for my sprite

0:33:56.159,0:33:59.519
since she has

0:33:57.200,0:34:01.679
different costumes is i'm going to drag

0:33:59.519,0:34:04.480
over a next costume

0:34:01.679,0:34:05.840
if your sprite only has one costume or

0:34:04.480,0:34:08.079
the different costumes don't look like

0:34:05.840,0:34:09.440
an animation you don't have to do that

0:34:08.079,0:34:10.960
but what i'm going to do here is now

0:34:09.440,0:34:12.800
it's going to kind of slow my guy down a

0:34:10.960,0:34:16.079
little bit to start with

0:34:12.800,0:34:17.440
and he's using his animation now what i

0:34:16.079,0:34:19.119
want to do is i want to see if he speeds

0:34:17.440,0:34:20.720
up so my fish is going to grab some food

0:34:19.119,0:34:22.159
pellets

0:34:20.720,0:34:24.079
and so you'll notice that now the enemy

0:34:22.159,0:34:27.280
speed for me is at 14

0:34:24.079,0:34:30.399
uh 16. so he it slowly

0:34:27.280,0:34:31.839
gets faster and faster right

0:34:30.399,0:34:35.040
and so you can kind of sense that he's

0:34:31.839,0:34:38.960
going faster now and then he ate my fish

0:34:35.040,0:34:41.280
head on so i'm actually pretty happy

0:34:38.960,0:34:42.399
with my code i've got an enemy speed

0:34:41.280,0:34:44.320
that increases

0:34:42.399,0:34:45.520
the only thing that i want to do is i

0:34:44.320,0:34:48.079
want to have more

0:34:45.520,0:34:49.760
enemies right now i could go into the

0:34:48.079,0:34:50.560
sprite library and i could get more

0:34:49.760,0:34:52.480
enemies

0:34:50.560,0:34:53.760
but i'm going to show you another trick

0:34:52.480,0:34:56.000
i'm going to show you this

0:34:53.760,0:34:57.760
upload sprite so what i'm going to do is

0:34:56.000,0:35:01.040
i'm going to go to the internet

0:34:57.760,0:35:03.599
so i'm going to go to to google

0:35:01.040,0:35:04.240
um and i'm gonna search for some type of

0:35:03.599,0:35:06.000
enemy

0:35:04.240,0:35:08.640
well if i'm a fish in the ocean one of

0:35:06.000,0:35:12.240
my main enemies uh is trash right

0:35:08.640,0:35:15.599
so i'm gonna click uh search for um soda

0:35:12.240,0:35:17.680
plastic rings so i'm

0:35:15.599,0:35:19.359
looking for images so whenever you're

0:35:17.680,0:35:21.200
looking for images in google you click

0:35:19.359,0:35:22.880
on images

0:35:21.200,0:35:24.960
and i actually want a certain type of

0:35:22.880,0:35:26.079
images i want images with transparent

0:35:24.960,0:35:28.640
backgrounds

0:35:26.079,0:35:30.800
you can improve the search results by

0:35:28.640,0:35:34.480
clicking on tools

0:35:30.800,0:35:35.760
uh color transparent so you type in what

0:35:34.480,0:35:37.599
you're searching for

0:35:35.760,0:35:39.359
and then you go to images i don't want

0:35:37.599,0:35:40.000
just any any images i want to go to

0:35:39.359,0:35:42.880
tools

0:35:40.000,0:35:44.560
i want transparent background images and

0:35:42.880,0:35:45.920
so now i've got some things that i think

0:35:44.560,0:35:47.680
that i want so i think that this one

0:35:45.920,0:35:49.280
looks pretty good

0:35:47.680,0:35:51.839
if it shows you this checker pattern

0:35:49.280,0:35:53.359
it's probably a transparent background

0:35:51.839,0:35:55.680
so you can right click on it and you can

0:35:53.359,0:35:59.200
say save image as

0:35:55.680,0:36:01.440
i will warn you that sometimes they

0:35:59.200,0:36:02.320
put they cheat like the internet's uh

0:36:01.440,0:36:04.000
ornery right

0:36:02.320,0:36:06.400
they put a checkerboard background on

0:36:04.000,0:36:08.079
there that's not actually transparent

0:36:06.400,0:36:10.960
now what i want to do over in sprite is

0:36:08.079,0:36:14.720
i want to say upload a sprite

0:36:10.960,0:36:17.040
and i'm going to pick my rings

0:36:14.720,0:36:18.079
um and so now my rings are part of this

0:36:17.040,0:36:19.520
and notice that since they had a

0:36:18.079,0:36:20.720
transparent background they look really

0:36:19.520,0:36:23.359
good right

0:36:20.720,0:36:24.800
i'm going to change their size and then

0:36:23.359,0:36:26.720
the nice thing about their code is that

0:36:24.800,0:36:27.760
their code is almost identical to the

0:36:26.720,0:36:29.200
sharks

0:36:27.760,0:36:31.440
the only thing that's different is where

0:36:29.200,0:36:33.119
it starts at right

0:36:31.440,0:36:35.359
when you have the same code it's nice

0:36:33.119,0:36:38.400
and easy you just

0:36:35.359,0:36:40.000
drag it from the shark over

0:36:38.400,0:36:41.839
and i want to drag both of these things

0:36:40.000,0:36:44.079
over

0:36:41.839,0:36:45.119
so now you can see my rings as soon as i

0:36:44.079,0:36:47.599
zoom out some

0:36:45.119,0:36:49.040
they should have the exact same code

0:36:47.599,0:36:50.000
where's the codec

0:36:49.040,0:36:52.720
all right i guess i'm going to do it

0:36:50.000,0:36:56.160
again so drag this one and drop it

0:36:52.720,0:36:58.720
on the rings there it came over

0:36:56.160,0:37:00.800
and the only thing that's different is

0:36:58.720,0:37:02.640
the starting position

0:37:00.800,0:37:04.720
so what i like to do is i like to put it

0:37:02.640,0:37:07.359
in the position that i want it

0:37:04.720,0:37:09.440
go to motion and then i can see that

0:37:07.359,0:37:10.720
what i really want is i want this go to

0:37:09.440,0:37:12.240
xy

0:37:10.720,0:37:14.640
now i can do i can do a couple of

0:37:12.240,0:37:16.320
different things i can just drop it in

0:37:14.640,0:37:18.640
after this one that would actually work

0:37:16.320,0:37:20.720
fine or i can get

0:37:18.640,0:37:22.400
rid of that one um or i could have just

0:37:20.720,0:37:24.240
changed the numbers in that one

0:37:22.400,0:37:25.839
so go add a couple of enemies what would

0:37:24.240,0:37:27.680
another good in may be

0:37:25.839,0:37:29.440
what did i use in my my first example oh

0:37:27.680,0:37:32.640
i used a water bottle

0:37:29.440,0:37:34.480
so i'm going to say water bottle

0:37:32.640,0:37:36.160
now one thing that annoys me about

0:37:34.480,0:37:38.160
google is it lost my my

0:37:36.160,0:37:40.079
tools color transparent so i have to

0:37:38.160,0:37:43.040
like put that back on every time

0:37:40.079,0:37:44.640
i'm not quite sure um and so you have to

0:37:43.040,0:37:47.119
try to find a good

0:37:44.640,0:37:48.240
um transparent background those are all

0:37:47.119,0:37:49.520
pretty good water bottles

0:37:48.240,0:37:52.800
i'm just gonna accept this one it'll be

0:37:49.520,0:37:54.160
fine right click save images

0:37:52.800,0:37:56.320
and i'm going to change there's a

0:37:54.160,0:37:58.720
shorter file name so bottle

0:37:56.320,0:38:00.240
is a good short name and you can see

0:37:58.720,0:38:01.359
i've already done this once

0:38:00.240,0:38:03.680
and then i'm going to come over to

0:38:01.359,0:38:04.960
scratch again i'm going to say upload

0:38:03.680,0:38:07.440
sprite

0:38:04.960,0:38:08.720
i'm going to pick that bottle image and

0:38:07.440,0:38:09.440
if it's got a good transparent

0:38:08.720,0:38:10.880
background

0:38:09.440,0:38:13.119
it should show up and kind of integrate

0:38:10.880,0:38:14.320
nicely with my game pretty common to

0:38:13.119,0:38:16.480
come in huge

0:38:14.320,0:38:18.160
i'm just going to make it a smaller size

0:38:16.480,0:38:20.160
so i think you kind of see the pattern

0:38:18.160,0:38:21.440
um and then you copy your code over from

0:38:20.160,0:38:24.640
another one

0:38:21.440,0:38:25.680
so you drop it in there you drop it in

0:38:24.640,0:38:27.520
there

0:38:25.680,0:38:29.040
and then the only thing that's different

0:38:27.520,0:38:32.079
about the code this time

0:38:29.040,0:38:34.560
is the starting position so go to

0:38:32.079,0:38:35.119
xy i'm going to put that one on and take

0:38:34.560,0:38:37.680
that one

0:38:35.119,0:38:38.320
out so i think that i've got a finished

0:38:37.680,0:38:40.320
game

0:38:38.320,0:38:41.599
so let's let me go ahead and try it so i

0:38:40.320,0:38:43.040
can get the the

0:38:41.599,0:38:45.440
the food i'm going to make a full screen

0:38:43.040,0:38:47.520
here i can get the food

0:38:45.440,0:38:49.920
um and my enemies get just a little bit

0:38:47.520,0:38:51.200
harder um and i can speed my fish up if

0:38:49.920,0:38:53.119
he's going too slow

0:38:51.200,0:38:55.280
uh so i'm going to go and try to get the

0:38:53.119,0:38:57.760

the camp

0:41:34.240,0:41:38.240
really impressed with your efforts uh

0:41:36.079,0:41:41.440
things we run this time is each sprite

0:41:38.240,0:41:43.119
has its own code science and art come

0:41:41.440,0:41:45.040
together in this interesting way so lots

0:41:43.119,0:41:47.760
of drawing and things like this

0:41:45.040,0:41:48.880
variables can tend to be commonplace uh

0:41:47.760,0:41:50.800
and useful

0:41:48.880,0:41:52.560
and we learned a new movement style and

0:41:50.800,0:41:54.880
about broadcast events

0:41:52.560,0:41:55.760
a great job accomplishing the video

0:41:54.880,0:42:03.839
today

0:41:55.760,0:42:03.839
