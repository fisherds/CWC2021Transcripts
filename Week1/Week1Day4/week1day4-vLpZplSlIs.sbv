[Music]

0:00:04.880,0:00:09.200
hey hey welcome back

0:00:06.160,0:00:11.120
it is day four of our camp uh i'm here

0:00:09.200,0:00:13.599
with my campers again let them introduce

0:00:11.120,0:00:18.000
themselves as always

0:00:13.599,0:00:20.960
neela hi i'm bowen yeah hi i'm keegan

0:00:18.000,0:00:22.800
hi i'm mckinley great so we've got a new

0:00:20.960,0:00:24.000
game for you today uh but before we get

0:00:22.800,0:00:25.599
into it let's just kind of quickly

0:00:24.000,0:00:26.640
review just a couple of the skills we

0:00:25.599,0:00:28.480
learned last time

0:00:26.640,0:00:30.000
uh yesterday's was our hardest game of

0:00:28.480,0:00:32.000
the camp uh it was this like

0:00:30.000,0:00:34.320
fish game going around you probably had

0:00:32.000,0:00:36.000
a different a different plan

0:00:34.320,0:00:37.360
and we learned all kinds of good skills

0:00:36.000,0:00:38.879
let's just kind of glance at some of the

0:00:37.360,0:00:40.719
skills that we learned

0:00:38.879,0:00:42.800
um we learned how to do race car

0:00:40.719,0:00:45.039
movements like changing our angle

0:00:42.800,0:00:46.079
but continuing to going forwards we

0:00:45.039,0:00:48.800
learned that we could draw

0:00:46.079,0:00:50.800
sprites um we learned that we could use

0:00:48.800,0:00:53.440
random numbers so like our objects

0:00:50.800,0:00:55.840
started off at random numbers

0:00:53.440,0:00:57.520
uh we learned how to broadcast events

0:00:55.840,0:00:59.520
last time so like when somebody hit him

0:00:57.520,0:01:01.520
they just said hey i hit him

0:00:59.520,0:01:02.559
we learned how to record custom sounds

0:01:01.520,0:01:04.960
like game over

0:01:02.559,0:01:06.200
um and we learned how to import images a

0:01:04.960,0:01:08.960
whole like

0:01:06.200,0:01:10.560
smorgasbord of skills last time we're

0:01:08.960,0:01:12.080
going to use a couple of those skills in

0:01:10.560,0:01:13.600
today's game

0:01:12.080,0:01:15.439
let's take a look at today's game so

0:01:13.600,0:01:19.119
it's called catching dinner

0:01:15.439,0:01:21.040
the theme of my game is that i have

0:01:19.119,0:01:22.479
avery again so i kind of like the avery

0:01:21.040,0:01:25.439
sprite um

0:01:22.479,0:01:27.360
and my avery is holding a basket and i'm

0:01:25.439,0:01:28.720
using the left arrow key to move her in

0:01:27.360,0:01:30.240
one direction

0:01:28.720,0:01:32.560
and the right arrow key to move her in

0:01:30.240,0:01:34.240
another direction and the goal is that

0:01:32.560,0:01:36.000
she's trying to catch things that would

0:01:34.240,0:01:38.960
be good for her to eat for dinner

0:01:36.000,0:01:40.159
so a taco a watermelon some bread those

0:01:38.960,0:01:41.920
are good things for dinner

0:01:40.159,0:01:44.000
but she tries to avoid things that would

0:01:41.920,0:01:45.520
be bad for dinner um in this case

0:01:44.000,0:01:47.119
the things that would be bad for dinner

0:01:45.520,0:01:49.119
is the the donuts right

0:01:47.119,0:01:51.280
um so i'm waiting for a donut to come if

0:01:49.119,0:01:54.240
i catch a donut

0:01:51.280,0:01:55.920
that's what finishes my game right so

0:01:54.240,0:01:57.119
that's the idea of this game

0:01:55.920,0:01:59.680
you can see that there's a score

0:01:57.119,0:02:02.320
involved and you try to catch as many

0:01:59.680,0:02:03.920
like good and healthy things as you can

0:02:02.320,0:02:06.799
but if you catch the bad thing

0:02:03.920,0:02:07.920
then it's game over before we dive in i

0:02:06.799,0:02:09.840
just want to point out that the

0:02:07.920,0:02:11.680
interesting thing about this game

0:02:09.840,0:02:13.599
is that there's one avery which is

0:02:11.680,0:02:16.480
probably what you would expect

0:02:13.599,0:02:17.440
but then there's only one sprite for the

0:02:16.480,0:02:20.080
good food

0:02:17.440,0:02:21.440
and only one sprite for the bad food so

0:02:20.080,0:02:22.640
how do we do that right because of

0:02:21.440,0:02:25.200
course there's like

0:02:22.640,0:02:26.879
all kinds of sprites falling um but

0:02:25.200,0:02:28.800
there's only one of them

0:02:26.879,0:02:30.959
down here and the nice thing about that

0:02:28.800,0:02:33.200
is that they all share the same code

0:02:30.959,0:02:34.640
which is cool but you're making clones

0:02:33.200,0:02:36.480
of them so if i was to make a clone of

0:02:34.640,0:02:38.080
myself i'd be like one of me

0:02:36.480,0:02:39.760
and then two of me and then four of me

0:02:38.080,0:02:40.800
and then eight of me uh there would be a

0:02:39.760,0:02:43.440
lot of clones

0:02:40.800,0:02:44.480
so we're gonna learn about cloning uh so

0:02:43.440,0:02:47.640
let's go ahead and

0:02:44.480,0:02:49.440
go to scratch so go ahead and go to

0:02:47.640,0:02:51.840
scratch.mit.edu

0:02:49.440,0:02:54.239
click on create and we'll start a new

0:02:51.840,0:02:56.879
game for today

0:02:54.239,0:02:58.879
so uh before we get started today uh

0:02:56.879,0:03:00.400
first i want to get rid of the cap

0:02:58.879,0:03:02.640
i want you to kind of do some of the

0:03:00.400,0:03:03.280
things to establish your theme and your

0:03:02.640,0:03:05.200
game

0:03:03.280,0:03:06.480
right up front so you can see that mine

0:03:05.200,0:03:08.000
is avery

0:03:06.480,0:03:10.319
avery is catching good foods and

0:03:08.000,0:03:11.200
avoiding bad foods decide what you think

0:03:10.319,0:03:12.879
your theme

0:03:11.200,0:03:15.040
should be and we're going to start off

0:03:12.879,0:03:17.680
by adding those sprites

0:03:15.040,0:03:19.840
so for me i want just avery so i'm going

0:03:17.680,0:03:21.360
to click on choose a sprite

0:03:19.840,0:03:22.879
and i'm going to go with avery right

0:03:21.360,0:03:26.080
here

0:03:22.879,0:03:27.440
if you want to you could choose to look

0:03:26.080,0:03:28.720
for something on the internet right so

0:03:27.440,0:03:30.560
if you wanted to get an image from the

0:03:28.720,0:03:31.680
internet uh remember last time how he

0:03:30.560,0:03:34.560
chose to like

0:03:31.680,0:03:36.319
do google searches and search for images

0:03:34.560,0:03:38.080
and then we went into tools and picked

0:03:36.319,0:03:39.519
ones with color transparency

0:03:38.080,0:03:41.280
you could do that if you wanted i'm not

0:03:39.519,0:03:42.080
going to do it here i'm just going to

0:03:41.280,0:03:43.840
pick avery

0:03:42.080,0:03:46.640
which is the sprite that i want i'm

0:03:43.840,0:03:48.879
going to resize avery a little bit

0:03:46.640,0:03:50.799
um and then what i choose to do is if

0:03:48.879,0:03:52.159
you look at my game i chose to give

0:03:50.799,0:03:54.799
avery

0:03:52.159,0:03:56.400
a bowl that she's holding how did i give

0:03:54.799,0:03:57.040
her a bowl that's kind of a sneaky thing

0:03:56.400,0:03:59.120
to do

0:03:57.040,0:04:01.439
i'm gonna show you how i did that if you

0:03:59.120,0:04:02.080
would like to give a bowl to your person

0:04:01.439,0:04:04.480
you can

0:04:02.080,0:04:06.000
but it is optional right so here's what

0:04:04.480,0:04:08.400
i'm going to do to to give her a bowl

0:04:06.000,0:04:10.799
i'm going to go into costumes

0:04:08.400,0:04:12.080
and i could try to draw a bowl but i'm

0:04:10.799,0:04:14.080
not a very good artist

0:04:12.080,0:04:15.599
so that would probably be a bad plan um

0:04:14.080,0:04:17.120
what i'm going to do is over here i'm

0:04:15.599,0:04:19.919
going to choose to

0:04:17.120,0:04:21.359
add a costume so over here you can add

0:04:19.919,0:04:23.520
sprites

0:04:21.359,0:04:25.040
and over here you can add more costumes

0:04:23.520,0:04:26.240
to the existing spray and that's a trick

0:04:25.040,0:04:29.840
we're going to use a lot today

0:04:26.240,0:04:32.960
so i'm going to say choose a costume

0:04:29.840,0:04:36.639
and i'm going to search for a bowl

0:04:32.960,0:04:38.320
so there's this bowl a that i found

0:04:36.639,0:04:40.080
now when i add the bowl it adds it as

0:04:38.320,0:04:41.680
like a separate sprite

0:04:40.080,0:04:45.440
but to fix that what you can do is you

0:04:41.680,0:04:48.240
can um highlight the whole area

0:04:45.440,0:04:50.160
and copy the bowl so i use ctrl c to

0:04:48.240,0:04:53.360
copy

0:04:50.160,0:04:55.280
come back into this one and ctrl v

0:04:53.360,0:04:57.919
to paste it in here and so you can see

0:04:55.280,0:05:00.320
that i can give her a bowl if i wanted

0:04:57.919,0:05:01.520
that's just a type of drawing trick that

0:05:00.320,0:05:04.000
you can use

0:05:01.520,0:05:05.440
where you add some other sprite and then

0:05:04.000,0:05:06.639
you kind of drag over the whole thing to

0:05:05.440,0:05:09.680
highlight it

0:05:06.639,0:05:11.199
and then you just use ctrl c to copy go

0:05:09.680,0:05:14.080
to where you want and control v

0:05:11.199,0:05:16.080
to paste now at the end of the day i

0:05:14.080,0:05:17.520
just want this one costume of avery i

0:05:16.080,0:05:18.720
don't need this one where she's standing

0:05:17.520,0:05:19.520
with her hands behind her back and i

0:05:18.720,0:05:22.000
don't need this one

0:05:19.520,0:05:23.360
i can actually delete those costumes and

0:05:22.000,0:05:25.680
nothing bad will happen

0:05:23.360,0:05:27.120
so just kind of a little trick there the

0:05:25.680,0:05:29.440
next thing i do is i want to pick my

0:05:27.120,0:05:31.039
good items and my bad items

0:05:29.440,0:05:32.960
again your theme can be different than

0:05:31.039,0:05:35.360
mine but i'm going to choose to add

0:05:32.960,0:05:38.080
foods as my good items so i'm going to

0:05:35.360,0:05:40.160
click on choose a sprite

0:05:38.080,0:05:42.960
uh and i'm gonna add one food maybe i'll

0:05:40.160,0:05:45.440
add the apple first

0:05:42.960,0:05:46.639
now um if you look at my game over here

0:05:45.440,0:05:48.479
here's what i did that was sneaky over

0:05:46.639,0:05:49.680
here is i added one food you can see i

0:05:48.479,0:05:51.039
added a taco first

0:05:49.680,0:05:54.560
and then i added a bunch of different

0:05:51.039,0:05:55.840
costumes to that one sprite

0:05:54.560,0:05:57.680
we're going to do the same thing so i've

0:05:55.840,0:05:59.919
got an apple

0:05:57.680,0:06:01.039
an apple currently has one costume in

0:05:59.919,0:06:02.319
him

0:06:01.039,0:06:04.479
and i'm going to choose to add more

0:06:02.319,0:06:07.280
costumes i'm going to add other costumes

0:06:04.479,0:06:08.800
of my sprites so maybe i'll go into food

0:06:07.280,0:06:09.520
and i'll just add a few foods right so

0:06:08.800,0:06:12.720
bananas

0:06:09.520,0:06:14.639
is a good food what's another good food

0:06:12.720,0:06:16.240
that i've got here i had tacos in my

0:06:14.639,0:06:17.199
other one maybe i should add a taco to

0:06:16.240,0:06:20.400
this one as well

0:06:17.199,0:06:21.520
tacos are delicious and then i'll add

0:06:20.400,0:06:25.759
one more just for fun

0:06:21.520,0:06:27.199
so i'll go to food and i'll have

0:06:25.759,0:06:28.880
i want it to be a good like healthy

0:06:27.199,0:06:30.639
thing watermelon looks like a good thing

0:06:28.880,0:06:32.560
to eat

0:06:30.639,0:06:34.080
so we're using costumes in a different

0:06:32.560,0:06:38.960
way this time you can see that i've got

0:06:34.080,0:06:41.120
one sprite and four different costumes

0:06:38.960,0:06:42.880
so costumes this time sometimes we use

0:06:41.120,0:06:44.160
costumes to make like animations but

0:06:42.880,0:06:45.360
this time we're like making it look

0:06:44.160,0:06:47.440
totally different

0:06:45.360,0:06:48.880
one one trick you do have to be careful

0:06:47.440,0:06:50.880
of is they do need to be roughly the

0:06:48.880,0:06:53.039
same size so you can see my apple

0:06:50.880,0:06:54.800
and my banana and my watermelon they're

0:06:53.039,0:06:56.479
all about the same size

0:06:54.800,0:06:58.960
but look at my taco it's kind of huge

0:06:56.479,0:07:00.400
right so if sometimes i show an apple or

0:06:58.960,0:07:01.840
sometimes i show a banana or sometimes

0:07:00.400,0:07:03.039
there's a watermelon that's fine but

0:07:01.840,0:07:04.319
then when i put the taco on it's

0:07:03.039,0:07:06.160
gigantic

0:07:04.319,0:07:09.039
you could make it smaller so i could

0:07:06.160,0:07:10.560
like make it smaller over here

0:07:09.039,0:07:12.960
but the problem is is that it makes my

0:07:10.560,0:07:14.560
apples and my bananas smaller so

0:07:12.960,0:07:16.000
with this trick you will occasionally

0:07:14.560,0:07:18.479
have to grab one

0:07:16.000,0:07:20.880
of them highlight the whole thing and

0:07:18.479,0:07:22.479
make them be roughly the same size

0:07:20.880,0:07:25.039
such that if you go between the apple

0:07:22.479,0:07:26.800
the banana the taco or the watermelon

0:07:25.039,0:07:29.520
they're all roughly the same size and

0:07:26.800,0:07:31.840
that i'm actually really happy with

0:07:29.520,0:07:33.759
so that's my good food my good food

0:07:31.840,0:07:38.319
right now is called apple

0:07:33.759,0:07:38.319
i'm going to change it to be a good item

0:07:39.280,0:07:41.680
if you don't want to change yours you

0:07:40.400,0:07:43.520
don't have to i just wanted to point out

0:07:41.680,0:07:44.960
you can change the names of your sprites

0:07:43.520,0:07:48.800
like avery here

0:07:44.960,0:07:51.199
in my mind she's my hero so whatever my

0:07:48.800,0:07:53.120
hero is i just name it hero

0:07:51.199,0:07:54.720
and then this is my good item next i

0:07:53.120,0:07:58.080
want to add a bad item

0:07:54.720,0:07:59.680
so i'm going to click on choose a sprite

0:07:58.080,0:08:00.639
and i'm going to pick a bad item what

0:07:59.680,0:08:01.599
i'm going to do is i'm going to pick

0:08:00.639,0:08:03.440
something that you would have for

0:08:01.599,0:08:05.120
dessert not for dinner

0:08:03.440,0:08:07.440
so i'm going to add donuts as my bad

0:08:05.120,0:08:07.440
item

0:08:07.680,0:08:13.039
and then i'm going to choose to rename

0:08:09.280,0:08:14.400
mine as bad item

0:08:13.039,0:08:18.000
and i'm going to make it roughly the

0:08:14.400,0:08:18.000
same size as my good item

0:08:20.160,0:08:23.199
now this style of coding is a little

0:08:21.840,0:08:24.639
different than what i've done before i'm

0:08:23.199,0:08:26.639
just kind of like getting my game

0:08:24.639,0:08:28.560
set up to start with and then i'm going

0:08:26.639,0:08:29.840
to start writing the code

0:08:28.560,0:08:31.520
and i'll just be able to knock things

0:08:29.840,0:08:32.640
out the other thing i want to do is i

0:08:31.520,0:08:35.200
want to backdrop

0:08:32.640,0:08:36.959
so i'm going to choose backdrop i think

0:08:35.200,0:08:38.240
in mine i actually picked like a jungle

0:08:36.959,0:08:39.599
theme

0:08:38.240,0:08:41.919
so i'll stick with the jungle for this

0:08:39.599,0:08:43.360
as well great

0:08:41.919,0:08:45.120
um so i'm going to pause it and i'm

0:08:43.360,0:08:47.200
going to let my campers get all their

0:08:45.120,0:08:48.959
objects figured out and then we'll start

0:08:47.200,0:08:50.320
in on the code so you can pause it and

0:08:48.959,0:08:52.480
you can get all your things figured out

0:08:50.320,0:08:55.040
so one hero

0:08:52.480,0:08:57.040
the good item has a variety of costumes

0:08:55.040,0:08:57.760
uh and then my bad item has only one

0:08:57.040,0:08:59.120
costume

0:08:57.760,0:09:01.680
all right see if you can make yours look

0:08:59.120,0:09:03.519
like mine all right so all my campers

0:09:01.680,0:09:05.519
got their heroes figured out they got

0:09:03.519,0:09:06.880
their various good items figured out uh

0:09:05.519,0:09:08.880
they got their badass and figure out

0:09:06.880,0:09:10.640
took us a little bit but we got there uh

0:09:08.880,0:09:12.640
let's dive into the code

0:09:10.640,0:09:13.839
um and i'm gonna start off with avery

0:09:12.640,0:09:15.920
which is our hero

0:09:13.839,0:09:18.000
so go ahead and find your uh your hero

0:09:15.920,0:09:21.040
whoever your hero is mine's avery

0:09:18.000,0:09:22.399
and let's go into the code this sprite's

0:09:21.040,0:09:23.920
going to be kind of the most similar to

0:09:22.399,0:09:24.959
things we've done in the past it's going

0:09:23.920,0:09:29.040
to start with

0:09:24.959,0:09:30.959
an event uh of when green flag clicked

0:09:29.040,0:09:33.519
so go and take a win green flag clicked

0:09:30.959,0:09:33.519
and bring it over

0:09:33.600,0:09:37.920
you could set her starting position if

0:09:35.760,0:09:39.760
you wanted to be the middle uh that's

0:09:37.920,0:09:41.440
optional i think i will go ahead and do

0:09:39.760,0:09:44.560
it so i'm going to go ahead and

0:09:41.440,0:09:46.000
find this go to xy

0:09:44.560,0:09:47.680
that way i'm guaranteed that she always

0:09:46.000,0:09:49.279
starts the game in the very middle

0:09:47.680,0:09:51.680
that's optional it doesn't really matter

0:09:49.279,0:09:52.959
but there's no harm in doing it

0:09:51.680,0:09:54.480
and then i'm going to do what i've done

0:09:52.959,0:09:55.600
so many times i'm going to make a

0:09:54.480,0:09:58.080
forever loop

0:09:55.600,0:10:00.160
so i'm going to drag out a forever loop

0:09:58.080,0:10:01.680
and snap it on here

0:10:00.160,0:10:03.519
you'll notice that this pattern happens

0:10:01.680,0:10:04.800
in a lot of our games when the green

0:10:03.519,0:10:07.519
flag is clicked

0:10:04.800,0:10:07.839
do some initialization things and then

0:10:07.519,0:10:10.240
do

0:10:07.839,0:10:11.920
some things forever the thing we're

0:10:10.240,0:10:12.880
going to do forever is we're going to

0:10:11.920,0:10:15.519
listen for

0:10:12.880,0:10:16.959
the left arrow and the right arrow and

0:10:15.519,0:10:18.160
so if the left arrow is pressed we'll

0:10:16.959,0:10:19.600
move to the left

0:10:18.160,0:10:21.040
if the right arrows press will move to

0:10:19.600,0:10:22.160
the right so we're going to add two if

0:10:21.040,0:10:26.079
statements

0:10:22.160,0:10:28.959
so drag two if statements number one

0:10:26.079,0:10:28.959
and number two

0:10:30.720,0:10:34.959
and then inside the if statements i want

0:10:33.120,0:10:37.040
to put a condition

0:10:34.959,0:10:38.079
so the condition that i care about is

0:10:37.040,0:10:40.800
the key press

0:10:38.079,0:10:41.600
so i'm going to go into sensing i'm

0:10:40.800,0:10:46.560
going to find

0:10:41.600,0:10:49.120
a key space pressed

0:10:46.560,0:10:51.440
and then of course it's got a little

0:10:49.120,0:10:52.800
white down arrow next to it

0:10:51.440,0:10:54.720
and so i'm going to click on this little

0:10:52.800,0:10:58.399
white down arrow and i'm going to change

0:10:54.720,0:11:00.320
it to left arrow for the top one

0:10:58.399,0:11:03.040
and then i'm going to change it to right

0:11:00.320,0:11:05.120
arrow for the bottom one

0:11:03.040,0:11:06.800
and again if you ever need to pause it i

0:11:05.120,0:11:08.720
mean definitely just pause the video

0:11:06.800,0:11:10.399
um and then you can get uh right cut up

0:11:08.720,0:11:12.399
door i'm doing

0:11:10.399,0:11:14.320
now inside left arrow and right arrow in

0:11:12.399,0:11:16.320
the past i've always done like

0:11:14.320,0:11:17.440
point in direction and then move some

0:11:16.320,0:11:19.120
amount

0:11:17.440,0:11:20.880
we could do that again but i'm just

0:11:19.120,0:11:23.680
going to show you an alternative

0:11:20.880,0:11:26.320
i'm going to just change the x value so

0:11:23.680,0:11:29.680
the x value is like the horizontal value

0:11:26.320,0:11:31.920
so i'm going to go into motion and for

0:11:29.680,0:11:35.120
both of these i'm going to have a change

0:11:31.920,0:11:42.240
x by so go and grab a change

0:11:35.120,0:11:44.959
x by and drop it into both places

0:11:42.240,0:11:45.519
now right now if you were to run the

0:11:44.959,0:11:48.560
game

0:11:45.519,0:11:50.079
um positive x would move to the right so

0:11:48.560,0:11:52.079
so the right arrow would work

0:11:50.079,0:11:53.120
it would be good but the left arrow is

0:11:52.079,0:11:54.720
not going to work

0:11:53.120,0:11:56.320
so campers what do i need to type in

0:11:54.720,0:11:58.399
here instead of ten

0:11:56.320,0:12:01.200
negative two yeah so i need to put in a

0:11:58.399,0:12:02.800
negative ten that's right

0:12:01.200,0:12:05.440
now the fun thing about this game is

0:12:02.800,0:12:08.000
that um avery's essentially done

0:12:05.440,0:12:09.200
um so i could run it and i could see if

0:12:08.000,0:12:12.000
i'm happy with that speed

0:12:09.200,0:12:13.519
so i hit on the go button and then if i

0:12:12.000,0:12:14.399
hit the right arrow should move to the

0:12:13.519,0:12:16.079
right

0:12:14.399,0:12:17.519
if i hit the left arrow she'll move to

0:12:16.079,0:12:19.600
the left

0:12:17.519,0:12:21.519
and so i think that avery is actually in

0:12:19.600,0:12:22.880
pretty good shape

0:12:21.519,0:12:24.880
we're going to have to check to see if

0:12:22.880,0:12:26.320
certain things are hitting her

0:12:24.880,0:12:27.920
but actually other sprites are going to

0:12:26.320,0:12:29.680
have that responsibility

0:12:27.920,0:12:31.279
her whole goal is just to move left and

0:12:29.680,0:12:31.760
right so she's kind of just like a

0:12:31.279,0:12:34.639
paddle

0:12:31.760,0:12:36.480
uh in a game another thing that we could

0:12:34.639,0:12:38.639
do if you wanted to do is we could make

0:12:36.480,0:12:41.120
a variable out of her speed

0:12:38.639,0:12:42.560
and so we could make make her variable

0:12:41.120,0:12:44.000
make her speed be a variable

0:12:42.560,0:12:45.360
and then we could set it once and use it

0:12:44.000,0:12:46.560
both places but honestly if it's just

0:12:45.360,0:12:49.600
these two right here

0:12:46.560,0:12:50.800
it's extra work to make a variable

0:12:49.600,0:12:53.279
so the next thing i want to do with

0:12:50.800,0:12:56.079
avery done is i want to save my game

0:12:53.279,0:12:58.000
so i'm going to call my game catching

0:12:56.079,0:12:59.600
dinner

0:12:58.000,0:13:01.040
if you want a different name for your

0:12:59.600,0:13:03.519
game that's just fine

0:13:01.040,0:13:05.279
but i'm going to type that in as my name

0:13:03.519,0:13:06.000
it does automatically save so you don't

0:13:05.279,0:13:10.399
have to do anything

0:13:06.000,0:13:12.320
else or you could hit file save now

0:13:10.399,0:13:14.240
and i'm going to help my campers type

0:13:12.320,0:13:16.399
some for the names of their game

0:13:14.240,0:13:18.079
all right so with avery doing well the

0:13:16.399,0:13:19.120
next thing i want to do is i want to be

0:13:18.079,0:13:20.720
able to make

0:13:19.120,0:13:23.040
food so i want to be able to make good

0:13:20.720,0:13:24.959
items and eventually bad items

0:13:23.040,0:13:26.079
now interestingly who should make the

0:13:24.959,0:13:28.160
foods

0:13:26.079,0:13:29.920
we could put that code on the hero's

0:13:28.160,0:13:31.200
right that would be fine

0:13:29.920,0:13:33.440
but i'm going to show you that you can

0:13:31.200,0:13:35.760
also put it on the stage so click over

0:13:33.440,0:13:37.680
here where it says stage

0:13:35.760,0:13:39.279
and you'll notice that the stage has

0:13:37.680,0:13:40.240
backdrops which we've already set a

0:13:39.279,0:13:42.399
backdrop on it

0:13:40.240,0:13:44.399
but a stage also has code so you could

0:13:42.399,0:13:45.600
totally put code in the backdrop

0:13:44.399,0:13:49.600
and that's what we're going to do this

0:13:45.600,0:13:52.000
time and so we want to go to events

0:13:49.600,0:13:54.240
we want to find when green flag is

0:13:52.000,0:13:56.240
clicked

0:13:54.240,0:13:57.760
and the code that the stage is going to

0:13:56.240,0:14:00.959
run is it's going to be

0:13:57.760,0:14:02.240
responsible for creating the good items

0:14:00.959,0:14:04.000
and the bad items

0:14:02.240,0:14:07.440
so he's going to also have a forever

0:14:04.000,0:14:09.920
loop so let's go to control

0:14:07.440,0:14:09.920
forever

0:14:12.240,0:14:16.240
and what the stage is going to do is

0:14:13.920,0:14:16.800
he's going to make a new good item every

0:14:16.240,0:14:18.240
second

0:14:16.800,0:14:20.399
so every second he's going to stick

0:14:18.240,0:14:22.399
another one on the screen

0:14:20.399,0:14:26.000
the way that he does that is first he

0:14:22.399,0:14:27.600
has a wait for one second

0:14:26.000,0:14:28.800
so he waits for a second and then he

0:14:27.600,0:14:30.399
does something and the thing that he

0:14:28.800,0:14:33.040
does it's actually in control here

0:14:30.399,0:14:36.240
scroll down and control

0:14:33.040,0:14:40.800
and find where it says create clone

0:14:36.240,0:14:42.079
of now we want to create a clone of not

0:14:40.800,0:14:44.880
the hero

0:14:42.079,0:14:46.720
but of the good item eventually we'll do

0:14:44.880,0:14:48.560
good and bad items but for now we're

0:14:46.720,0:14:50.800
just going to do good items

0:14:48.560,0:14:52.160
and so the neat thing about this is that

0:14:50.800,0:14:54.399
if you run it

0:14:52.160,0:14:56.000
it will actually create a clone of

0:14:54.399,0:14:57.680
whatever your good item is mine is

0:14:56.000,0:14:59.760
currently set to a watermelon

0:14:57.680,0:15:01.839
now the question is where will it put it

0:14:59.760,0:15:02.800
right we can run it and we can see what

0:15:01.839,0:15:04.480
it does by default

0:15:02.800,0:15:06.560
so it's creating a clone of my

0:15:04.480,0:15:08.160
watermelon it's not very exciting

0:15:06.560,0:15:10.079
because it appears as though it's

0:15:08.160,0:15:12.399
making it right on top of the old

0:15:10.079,0:15:14.480
watermelon right so that's not much fun

0:15:12.399,0:15:16.240
so let's make it more interesting so

0:15:14.480,0:15:18.160
let's make the watermelon like go to

0:15:16.240,0:15:20.959
some position when it starts

0:15:18.160,0:15:23.279
so the stage is done now go into the

0:15:20.959,0:15:24.399
watermelon

0:15:23.279,0:15:26.160
now we're going to do something very

0:15:24.399,0:15:27.279
different here normally we start with

0:15:26.160,0:15:30.079
this

0:15:27.279,0:15:30.480
this event for when green flags clicked

0:15:30.079,0:15:32.160
that's

0:15:30.480,0:15:33.440
not what we're going to do this time

0:15:32.160,0:15:34.399
we're going to start with a different

0:15:33.440,0:15:36.880
event

0:15:34.399,0:15:37.680
it's down here in control and it's when

0:15:36.880,0:15:42.160
i start

0:15:37.680,0:15:43.680
as a clone so whenever i stars a clone

0:15:42.160,0:15:46.720
i'm going to do some stuff so this is

0:15:43.680,0:15:49.839
different than what we've done before

0:15:46.720,0:15:53.519
the things that i want to do i want to

0:15:49.839,0:15:54.800
go to some x position some x exposition

0:15:53.519,0:15:57.120
at the top of the screen

0:15:54.800,0:15:58.160
so i'm going to go somewhere up here so

0:15:57.120,0:15:59.519
here's what i'm going to do i'm going to

0:15:58.160,0:16:01.199
take my good item and i'm going to move

0:15:59.519,0:16:04.000
it to roughly the top

0:16:01.199,0:16:06.560
just like somewhere near the top and

0:16:04.000,0:16:10.959
then i'm going to go to motion

0:16:06.560,0:16:10.959
and i'm going to find this go to xy

0:16:11.600,0:16:15.519
now if you think about what this game

0:16:13.040,0:16:16.560
does as it's playing is all things start

0:16:15.519,0:16:19.440
at the top

0:16:16.560,0:16:19.920
but they kind of start randomly along

0:16:19.440,0:16:22.079
the top

0:16:19.920,0:16:23.440
somewhere along the top so how do we do

0:16:22.079,0:16:25.279
that

0:16:23.440,0:16:26.800
so this would make it always go to that

0:16:25.279,0:16:30.079
spot which is no good

0:16:26.800,0:16:32.959
we want to go to a random x at this

0:16:30.079,0:16:37.519
y which is nearly at 180 right so to get

0:16:32.959,0:16:39.839
a random value we click on operators

0:16:37.519,0:16:42.240
inside operators find pick a random

0:16:39.839,0:16:42.240
number

0:16:44.800,0:16:48.560
and the random values for x if we

0:16:47.360,0:16:51.600
remember

0:16:48.560,0:16:52.320
from from previous days this uh screen

0:16:51.600,0:16:54.800
goes from

0:16:52.320,0:16:56.000
negative 240 which i guess i could just

0:16:54.800,0:16:57.440
move this over here and i can kind of

0:16:56.000,0:17:00.639
see that so it goes from like

0:16:57.440,0:17:03.120
negative 240 all the way over

0:17:00.639,0:17:06.400
to positive 240. so i want to pick a

0:17:03.120,0:17:10.079
random number from negative 2 4 0

0:17:06.400,0:17:10.079
to positive 2 4 0.

0:17:10.880,0:17:15.439
so now uh whenever we run this game a

0:17:13.439,0:17:17.120
new watermelon should show up somewhere

0:17:15.439,0:17:20.079
along the top so i took my original and

0:17:17.120,0:17:22.319
i kind of moved it back to here

0:17:20.079,0:17:24.880
so now when you run your game uh every

0:17:22.319,0:17:28.160
second a new watermelon should show up

0:17:24.880,0:17:29.600
at some random position

0:17:28.160,0:17:31.200
and so they're just kind of collecting

0:17:29.600,0:17:34.320
up there they're not moving

0:17:31.200,0:17:36.320
they're just they're just collecting

0:17:34.320,0:17:37.679
by the way mine's a watermelon just

0:17:36.320,0:17:39.120
because that's the costume that i've

0:17:37.679,0:17:40.480
currently clicked on if i click on an

0:17:39.120,0:17:42.720
apple

0:17:40.480,0:17:43.919
and i run it again then all my apples

0:17:42.720,0:17:45.440
are going to show up at the top

0:17:43.919,0:17:46.799
so it's kind of neat how it's the same

0:17:45.440,0:17:48.400
sprite it's just going to have a

0:17:46.799,0:17:50.000
different costume

0:17:48.400,0:17:52.000
all right let's do some more things with

0:17:50.000,0:17:53.120
our good item so we don't want it to

0:17:52.000,0:17:55.200
always be

0:17:53.120,0:17:56.240
uh an apple or always be a watermelon we

0:17:55.200,0:18:00.240
want to switch

0:17:56.240,0:18:04.720
what it is so let's go into looks

0:18:00.240,0:18:07.200
uh let's go into switch costume 2

0:18:04.720,0:18:09.120
and this is kind of tricky about scratch

0:18:07.200,0:18:10.080
it looks like there's a drop down arrow

0:18:09.120,0:18:12.880
here and you can actually

0:18:10.080,0:18:14.160
pick like you know apples if you wanted

0:18:12.880,0:18:16.559
to be apples but then they'd all be

0:18:14.160,0:18:19.039
apples or bananas and it'll be animals

0:18:16.559,0:18:20.960
we want to pick a random costume so go

0:18:19.039,0:18:24.240
into operators

0:18:20.960,0:18:24.240
find this pick random

0:18:24.320,0:18:28.799
and the fun thing about switch costume 2

0:18:26.880,0:18:31.039
is it can also receive a number

0:18:28.799,0:18:32.320
so you can see that i have four costumes

0:18:31.039,0:18:35.360
and there's a little number up here

0:18:32.320,0:18:37.200
one two three or four

0:18:35.360,0:18:39.120
so i can refer to them by their name or

0:18:37.200,0:18:41.360
their number which is really handy

0:18:39.120,0:18:42.799
so i want to pick a random number since

0:18:41.360,0:18:44.720
i have four costumes

0:18:42.799,0:18:48.000
one two three four i'm going to pick a

0:18:44.720,0:18:49.440
random number from one to four

0:18:48.000,0:18:52.160
and so this is going to pick a random

0:18:49.440,0:18:54.160
position and then a random costume

0:18:52.160,0:18:56.400
now if i hit the play button what

0:18:54.160,0:18:58.480
happens is it's not always an apple

0:18:56.400,0:19:00.400
sometimes it's an apple sometimes it's a

0:18:58.480,0:19:01.840
banana sometimes it's a taco sometimes

0:19:00.400,0:19:03.200
it's a watermelon

0:19:01.840,0:19:04.640
and your game should be able to do the

0:19:03.200,0:19:05.120
same thing and eventually the top will

0:19:04.640,0:19:07.520
get

0:19:05.120,0:19:10.080
really crowded with different food that

0:19:07.520,0:19:13.200
you might want to eat

0:19:10.080,0:19:15.440
great so we're doing really good

0:19:13.200,0:19:17.200
more initialization code i want them to

0:19:15.440,0:19:19.360
fall at a certain speed

0:19:17.200,0:19:21.600
um and i want that speed if we go look

0:19:19.360,0:19:22.240
at this one to not always be the same

0:19:21.600,0:19:24.000
right

0:19:22.240,0:19:25.360
so you can see how some fault that

0:19:24.000,0:19:27.280
watermelon just flew through

0:19:25.360,0:19:29.280
super fast right so they fall at

0:19:27.280,0:19:30.640
different speeds is our goal

0:19:29.280,0:19:32.640
so that's what we're going to do next

0:19:30.640,0:19:35.280
we're going to make a different speeds

0:19:32.640,0:19:36.960
um so i want to make a variable so we've

0:19:35.280,0:19:40.000
done variables many times

0:19:36.960,0:19:43.919
you click on variables click on

0:19:40.000,0:19:46.960
make a variable this variable

0:19:43.919,0:19:48.320
is going to be just for this sprite and

0:19:46.960,0:19:49.760
this is important because they can all

0:19:48.320,0:19:52.320
be different speeds right

0:19:49.760,0:19:54.000
so i'm going to call it just speed if

0:19:52.320,0:19:56.160
you wanted to you could call it fall

0:19:54.000,0:19:58.960
speed or good item speed

0:19:56.160,0:20:01.520
but i'm just going to call it speed i'm

0:19:58.960,0:20:01.520
say okay

0:20:01.679,0:20:04.720
and then what i'm going to do i want to

0:20:02.880,0:20:06.080
get rid of my variable i don't want my

0:20:04.720,0:20:09.280
variable in here i'm just going to right

0:20:06.080,0:20:10.880
click on it and say delete my variable

0:20:09.280,0:20:12.400
i like to delete it because then

0:20:10.880,0:20:15.280
whenever i drag something over

0:20:12.400,0:20:16.720
like if i drag over the set speed to it

0:20:15.280,0:20:18.799
it's going to default to saying speed

0:20:16.720,0:20:20.720
instead of my variable

0:20:18.799,0:20:22.880
and the speed we want is a random

0:20:20.720,0:20:26.080
variable uh which is uh kind of fun so

0:20:22.880,0:20:28.080
there's lots of random in this game

0:20:26.080,0:20:29.360
this is the fall speed this is how fast

0:20:28.080,0:20:32.080
does it fall

0:20:29.360,0:20:33.360
fall speeds should be negative and so

0:20:32.080,0:20:34.000
what i'm going to do is i'm going to do

0:20:33.360,0:20:37.280
a range of

0:20:34.000,0:20:39.200
negative 6 to negative 2. if you want

0:20:37.280,0:20:41.039
your stuff to potentially fall really

0:20:39.200,0:20:42.640
fast you could do negative 10 but that's

0:20:41.039,0:20:43.919
going to be really fast

0:20:42.640,0:20:46.480
if you wanted to fall really slow you

0:20:43.919,0:20:47.760
could do negative 1. but negative 6 is

0:20:46.480,0:20:50.799
pretty darn fast

0:20:47.760,0:20:54.080
and negative 2 is slow enough for me

0:20:50.799,0:20:55.760
so that's the full speed now we want to

0:20:54.080,0:20:57.440
actually start falling

0:20:55.760,0:20:59.200
so to actually start falling we need to

0:20:57.440,0:21:02.559
do something forever

0:20:59.200,0:21:05.520
so i'm going to put in a forever in here

0:21:02.559,0:21:06.559
and then i'm going to go into motion and

0:21:05.520,0:21:10.240
i'm going to find

0:21:06.559,0:21:12.799
change y by

0:21:10.240,0:21:13.919
so again today we're using this change x

0:21:12.799,0:21:15.840
y and change y

0:21:13.919,0:21:17.520
by which is just a little bit different

0:21:15.840,0:21:21.200
than move by

0:21:17.520,0:21:22.720
but change y by speed

0:21:21.200,0:21:25.520
so i'm going to go into variables and

0:21:22.720,0:21:25.520
put in speed

0:21:25.600,0:21:30.640
and i'm going to try to run it again and

0:21:26.960,0:21:33.039
so now they should all start falling

0:21:30.640,0:21:34.400
so now everybody shows up at the top uh

0:21:33.039,0:21:36.240
and then they start falling which is

0:21:34.400,0:21:37.919
cool

0:21:36.240,0:21:39.520
all right so things are going good by

0:21:37.919,0:21:41.600
the way what one of my campers had as a

0:21:39.520,0:21:43.679
problem is he accidentally put in a

0:21:41.600,0:21:45.120
switch backdrop too to insta switch

0:21:43.679,0:21:45.520
costume don't do that make sure it says

0:21:45.120,0:21:47.919
switch

0:21:45.520,0:21:49.200
costume too um so things are going good

0:21:47.919,0:21:49.919
but there's a few things that we need to

0:21:49.200,0:21:51.919
fix

0:21:49.919,0:21:53.600
one thing that's confusing is that my

0:21:51.919,0:21:55.919
original is sitting right here

0:21:53.600,0:21:57.280
right and my original actually doesn't

0:21:55.919,0:21:58.640
get used in the game

0:21:57.280,0:22:00.559
so here's what i want to do i want to

0:21:58.640,0:22:02.880
hide a couple things so i want to click

0:22:00.559,0:22:04.240
on my original which is the apple

0:22:02.880,0:22:06.400
and see how there's this show button

0:22:04.240,0:22:07.280
here so it's got like an eyeball or then

0:22:06.400,0:22:11.200
like an eyeball

0:22:07.280,0:22:13.679
crossed out i want to hide my original

0:22:11.200,0:22:14.720
now hiding your original is good um but

0:22:13.679,0:22:16.320
the problem is

0:22:14.720,0:22:18.480
is that all the clones of it are also

0:22:16.320,0:22:21.760
hidden right so that's easy to fix

0:22:18.480,0:22:23.679
so we hide the original and then in code

0:22:21.760,0:22:25.520
so in code we go into looks we find

0:22:23.679,0:22:27.919
where it says show

0:22:25.520,0:22:29.679
um and we just stick a show on here just

0:22:27.919,0:22:31.360
before the forever loop

0:22:29.679,0:22:33.039
so i i let it go ahead and pick its

0:22:31.360,0:22:34.720
position while it's still hidden switch

0:22:33.039,0:22:36.400
its costume while it's still hidden

0:22:34.720,0:22:38.840
set the speed while still hidden and

0:22:36.400,0:22:40.799
then i show it and then it starts to

0:22:38.840,0:22:41.840
fall the other thing i'm going to do

0:22:40.799,0:22:42.960
really quick is i'm going to go into

0:22:41.840,0:22:44.640
variables

0:22:42.960,0:22:46.559
and i'm going to check this box next to

0:22:44.640,0:22:48.480
speed because i

0:22:46.559,0:22:50.000
i don't need that showing up up there

0:22:48.480,0:22:51.280
right it doesn't really add anything to

0:22:50.000,0:22:53.679
the game

0:22:51.280,0:22:55.200
so now if i run it again you can see

0:22:53.679,0:22:58.240
that it has

0:22:55.200,0:22:59.840
different clones that fall so i've got

0:22:58.240,0:23:01.919
different clones that are falling

0:22:59.840,0:23:03.440
and my original is hidden right so

0:23:01.919,0:23:04.960
that's an important thing to do in these

0:23:03.440,0:23:06.720
games

0:23:04.960,0:23:09.039
now the next thing we want to do is that

0:23:06.720,0:23:11.520
if you catch one of these food

0:23:09.039,0:23:12.720
you'll see that nothing happens and also

0:23:11.520,0:23:13.760
you can see that when they get to the

0:23:12.720,0:23:16.000
bottom

0:23:13.760,0:23:17.039
nothing happens at the bottom either and

0:23:16.000,0:23:20.720
so we want to

0:23:17.039,0:23:22.559
if you catch one score point

0:23:20.720,0:23:24.000
and if it gets to the bottom we just

0:23:22.559,0:23:26.320
want it to disappear

0:23:24.000,0:23:28.080
and just not score any points for you so

0:23:26.320,0:23:30.400
let's go ahead and add those

0:23:28.080,0:23:31.919
um in code if we're trying to check for

0:23:30.400,0:23:33.039
different conditions those are if

0:23:31.919,0:23:35.600
statements

0:23:33.039,0:23:37.200
so in addition to falling we want to add

0:23:35.600,0:23:39.679
a couple of if statements so i'm going

0:23:37.200,0:23:41.120
to go into control

0:23:39.679,0:23:43.440
and i'm going to drag over an if

0:23:41.120,0:23:43.760
statement this top one's going to be for

0:23:43.440,0:23:46.320
like

0:23:43.760,0:23:49.039
if i'm touching the hero and i'm going

0:23:46.320,0:23:50.400
to drag over another if statement

0:23:49.039,0:23:52.000
and this bottom one is going to be for

0:23:50.400,0:23:52.720
like if i'm touching the bottom of the

0:23:52.000,0:23:54.159
screen

0:23:52.720,0:23:56.640
which we're just going to check the x

0:23:54.159,0:23:58.000
value getting so low

0:23:56.640,0:24:00.640
uh great so let's go ahead and put in

0:23:58.000,0:24:04.000
those two conditions the condition

0:24:00.640,0:24:06.799
for the first one is in sensing touching

0:24:04.000,0:24:06.799
mouse pointer

0:24:08.240,0:24:11.200
obviously touching mouse pointer is not

0:24:09.919,0:24:12.960
what we want but that's why there's this

0:24:11.200,0:24:14.559
little white drop down

0:24:12.960,0:24:16.799
and we're gonna switch it to if i'm

0:24:14.559,0:24:19.760
touching uh the hero

0:24:16.799,0:24:21.840
so i renamed avery earlier to be hero i

0:24:19.760,0:24:23.919
just typed her name in right there

0:24:21.840,0:24:24.960
so if we're touching the hero what

0:24:23.919,0:24:26.400
should happen

0:24:24.960,0:24:28.240
so let's go ahead and look at the the

0:24:26.400,0:24:31.919
solution over here and see what happens

0:24:28.240,0:24:32.559
well what happens is it scores a point

0:24:31.919,0:24:35.679
um

0:24:32.559,0:24:37.200
makes a pop sound um and makes it

0:24:35.679,0:24:39.440
go invisible there i touched the bad

0:24:37.200,0:24:40.720
item we'll get to the bad item

0:24:39.440,0:24:42.480
so there are like three things that will

0:24:40.720,0:24:44.720
happen fast we wanted to make a pop

0:24:42.480,0:24:46.480
sound so make some sound effect

0:24:44.720,0:24:48.640
let's go into sounds and see what sound

0:24:46.480,0:24:51.200
this one has right now mine has

0:24:48.640,0:24:51.919
chomp i guess i could play chomp chomp

0:24:51.200,0:24:53.840
is fine my

0:24:51.919,0:24:55.840
my original code played pop so i'm gonna

0:24:53.840,0:25:00.240
go into sound

0:24:55.840,0:25:02.640
i'm gonna say play chomp until done

0:25:00.240,0:25:04.159
so that's one thing we wanted to do the

0:25:02.640,0:25:05.279
next thing we want to do is we wanted to

0:25:04.159,0:25:06.400
score a point

0:25:05.279,0:25:08.480
so we're going to have to have a

0:25:06.400,0:25:11.200
variable for score so i'm going to go

0:25:08.480,0:25:14.720
into variables

0:25:11.200,0:25:17.360
make a variable

0:25:14.720,0:25:18.400
and this one's going to be called score

0:25:17.360,0:25:20.960
now score

0:25:18.400,0:25:23.039
is very different than speed score is

0:25:20.960,0:25:24.480
shared by everybody so anybody can

0:25:23.039,0:25:26.559
increment score there's only

0:25:24.480,0:25:28.240
one score in the whole game it's not

0:25:26.559,0:25:30.240
like everybody has their own individual

0:25:28.240,0:25:32.799
score there's one score so score

0:25:30.240,0:25:35.120
is for all sprites and i'm going to say

0:25:32.799,0:25:35.120
okay

0:25:35.440,0:25:38.720
now whenever you make a variable uh

0:25:37.360,0:25:40.480
there's a couple things you have to do

0:25:38.720,0:25:41.200
you have to create the variable which is

0:25:40.480,0:25:43.200
one

0:25:41.200,0:25:44.960
you have to initialize its value because

0:25:43.200,0:25:46.159
you don't want your score to like start

0:25:44.960,0:25:47.440
like where you left off the previous

0:25:46.159,0:25:48.799
game so we've got to initialize the

0:25:47.440,0:25:51.279
value somewhere

0:25:48.799,0:25:52.159
you can initialize its value in a lot of

0:25:51.279,0:25:54.640
places

0:25:52.159,0:25:56.080
the best place in my opinion is actually

0:25:54.640,0:25:57.440
back over in the stage so i know we're

0:25:56.080,0:26:00.000
working on the good food

0:25:57.440,0:26:01.679
but just for a minute i click over here

0:26:00.000,0:26:03.360
on the stage

0:26:01.679,0:26:04.960
so we're going to go over to his code

0:26:03.360,0:26:09.279
really quick

0:26:04.960,0:26:11.520
and i'm going to set score to zero

0:26:09.279,0:26:12.960
right after the green flag is clicked

0:26:11.520,0:26:14.320
and so this makes sense whenever the

0:26:12.960,0:26:16.159
game starts

0:26:14.320,0:26:18.799
my stage is code it's kind of like the

0:26:16.159,0:26:20.159
main code it's going to reset the score

0:26:18.799,0:26:22.080
to be zero

0:26:20.159,0:26:23.520
um and then the game is going to begin

0:26:22.080,0:26:26.080
with all these clones

0:26:23.520,0:26:27.039
all right so making the variable good

0:26:26.080,0:26:29.840
first step

0:26:27.039,0:26:33.120
initializing it to zero great next step

0:26:29.840,0:26:34.720
now let's go into your good item

0:26:33.120,0:26:36.400
and inside the good item we want to

0:26:34.720,0:26:39.120
change the score

0:26:36.400,0:26:40.480
so after we play our sound um or before

0:26:39.120,0:26:41.360
it doesn't really matter on the order

0:26:40.480,0:26:42.720
here

0:26:41.360,0:26:44.640
i'm going to put it before just because

0:26:42.720,0:26:47.520
i feel like it

0:26:44.640,0:26:49.919
so i'm going to change the score by one

0:26:47.520,0:26:51.440
i'm going to play a chomp sound

0:26:49.919,0:26:53.600
and i'm going to play it until it's done

0:26:51.440,0:26:56.240
just so you hear the whole sound

0:26:53.600,0:26:57.279
and then i'm going to disappear um and

0:26:56.240,0:26:58.559
the way we're going to disappear is

0:26:57.279,0:27:02.000
we're not going to hide

0:26:58.559,0:27:04.559
um we're going to go into control

0:27:02.000,0:27:07.279
and see where it says delete this clone

0:27:04.559,0:27:09.279
drag over and delete this clone

0:27:07.279,0:27:11.200
so easy comm easy to go so this clone

0:27:09.279,0:27:13.279
was made uh it fell

0:27:11.200,0:27:14.400
a little bit and then this one hit the

0:27:13.279,0:27:16.159
hero

0:27:14.400,0:27:19.600
it made a sound and then commanded the

0:27:16.159,0:27:22.640
score and then it got deleted

0:27:19.600,0:27:24.880
so let's try to play the game again try

0:27:22.640,0:27:28.480
to catch your first one that comes

0:27:24.880,0:27:31.360
i mean it should make a bite sound

0:27:28.480,0:27:32.240
and that's good now if you don't catch

0:27:31.360,0:27:33.919
them

0:27:32.240,0:27:36.000
something else happens they just end up

0:27:33.919,0:27:37.279
down here on the bottom right

0:27:36.000,0:27:38.640
and they end up down here in the bottom

0:27:37.279,0:27:40.000
you can actually just walk over and i

0:27:38.640,0:27:40.799
think you can still collect them from

0:27:40.000,0:27:44.080
the bottom right

0:27:40.799,0:27:44.080
that make the game kind of easy

0:27:44.799,0:27:48.159
so let's fix that so whenever they get

0:27:46.559,0:27:50.000
to the bottom or whenever they get

0:27:48.159,0:27:51.919
to a certain height we're going to say

0:27:50.000,0:27:52.320
hey you can no longer just walk over and

0:27:51.919,0:27:54.000
collect

0:27:52.320,0:27:55.360
them right so whenever they get to a

0:27:54.000,0:27:56.480
certain height that's going to be this

0:27:55.360,0:27:58.080
next if statement

0:27:56.480,0:28:00.159
we're going to just delete them and you

0:27:58.080,0:28:02.000
can't possibly score a point

0:28:00.159,0:28:03.520
so what we want to check for is we want

0:28:02.000,0:28:06.799
to check if

0:28:03.520,0:28:08.320
their y position is less than some

0:28:06.799,0:28:10.159
negative value

0:28:08.320,0:28:12.399
so uh the first thing i need here to go

0:28:10.159,0:28:16.399
in this diamond is an operator

0:28:12.399,0:28:20.240
for less than

0:28:16.399,0:28:23.679
so if the y position the y position

0:28:20.240,0:28:23.679
is something we can get from motion

0:28:26.799,0:28:31.039
so if the y position is less than some

0:28:29.600,0:28:33.679
number

0:28:31.039,0:28:37.039
the question is what's that number right

0:28:33.679,0:28:38.480
if you were to type in negative 180

0:28:37.039,0:28:40.559
that would actually be bad because that

0:28:38.480,0:28:41.360
would be like the very bottom of the

0:28:40.559,0:28:43.520
screen

0:28:41.360,0:28:44.640
so you could probably do like negative

0:28:43.520,0:28:46.000
170

0:28:44.640,0:28:48.000
that's just like a little bit up from

0:28:46.000,0:28:49.919
the screen or you could be like

0:28:48.000,0:28:51.760
really conservative and do like negative

0:28:49.919,0:28:53.039
160 which is what i think i'm going to

0:28:51.760,0:28:55.919
do

0:28:53.039,0:28:58.240
so i'm going to say if my y position is

0:28:55.919,0:28:59.440
less than negative 160

0:28:58.240,0:29:01.600
so i'm going to grab my donut and just

0:28:59.440,0:29:02.720
kind of show you where 160 is it's like

0:29:01.600,0:29:05.440
160 is

0:29:02.720,0:29:06.320
it's pretty low right so i guess my

0:29:05.440,0:29:08.159
donut can get

0:29:06.320,0:29:10.399
get there there it's negative 160 so

0:29:08.159,0:29:13.039
really low actually 160 may not

0:29:10.399,0:29:15.039
be conservative enough i'm gonna do 150.

0:29:13.039,0:29:17.840
so if you get below 150

0:29:15.039,0:29:18.880
which is about this height then i'm

0:29:17.840,0:29:20.720
going to delete

0:29:18.880,0:29:22.080
the clone so i'm going to go into

0:29:20.720,0:29:26.240
control

0:29:22.080,0:29:29.120
and i'm going to say delete this clone

0:29:26.240,0:29:29.120
try your game again

0:29:30.080,0:29:33.919
so if you catch them in the air you get

0:29:31.520,0:29:33.919
points

0:29:34.399,0:29:38.399
but if they get to the bottom uh they

0:29:36.480,0:29:39.840
just kind of disappear right

0:29:38.399,0:29:41.919
so you can see that they just disappear

0:29:39.840,0:29:44.640
which is good

0:29:41.919,0:29:45.840
great i'm actually really happy uh with

0:29:44.640,0:29:48.240
the good item

0:29:45.840,0:29:50.240
uh and things are things are going great

0:29:48.240,0:29:52.480
i'm gonna help my campers out

0:29:50.240,0:29:53.360
all right so the good item i think is in

0:29:52.480,0:29:54.720
pretty good shape

0:29:53.360,0:29:56.720
and now we're going to go through and do

0:29:54.720,0:29:59.279
the bad item so

0:29:56.720,0:30:00.799
the bad item uh just like we did before

0:29:59.279,0:30:01.679
it's going to get created by the

0:30:00.799,0:30:03.120
backdrop

0:30:01.679,0:30:05.120
so go ahead and click over here where it

0:30:03.120,0:30:06.840
says stage

0:30:05.120,0:30:08.960
and you can see that we've got code over

0:30:06.840,0:30:11.360
here so obviously

0:30:08.960,0:30:13.279
we create a good item now here's what i

0:30:11.360,0:30:14.880
want to do take this create good item

0:30:13.279,0:30:16.000
just set it over here to the side just

0:30:14.880,0:30:17.440
for a minute

0:30:16.000,0:30:19.279
and what we're going to do is sometimes

0:30:17.440,0:30:20.480
we're going to create good items

0:30:19.279,0:30:23.840
and then other times we're going to

0:30:20.480,0:30:23.840
create bad items right

0:30:24.880,0:30:28.000
now what our game is going to do is it's

0:30:26.640,0:30:30.080
going to randomly pick

0:30:28.000,0:30:31.520
a good item or a bad item to drop so

0:30:30.080,0:30:32.480
it's just going to randomly just like

0:30:31.520,0:30:33.600
drop one

0:30:32.480,0:30:37.840
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:30:33.600,0:30:37.840
add an if else statement in here

0:30:38.320,0:30:40.960
and this condition we're going to come

0:30:39.600,0:30:42.720
back to it but sometimes we're going to

0:30:40.960,0:30:44.240
drop a good item

0:30:42.720,0:30:45.840
and then in the other situation we're

0:30:44.240,0:30:48.480
going to drop a bad item so

0:30:45.840,0:30:50.080
this condition is going to decide which

0:30:48.480,0:30:52.720
one it's going to be this time

0:30:50.080,0:30:53.919
and that's where if then and then else

0:30:52.720,0:30:56.880
statements can be good

0:30:53.919,0:30:58.799
so how do we make it drop good items

0:30:56.880,0:31:00.799
sometimes bad items other times

0:30:58.799,0:31:02.880
well we're going to use a combination of

0:31:00.799,0:31:04.880
operators

0:31:02.880,0:31:07.120
so we're going to use a less than symbol

0:31:04.880,0:31:07.120
again

0:31:07.360,0:31:11.840
and a random number so into this

0:31:10.480,0:31:13.600
the left-hand side we're going to put a

0:31:11.840,0:31:14.640
random number so we're going to pick a

0:31:13.600,0:31:18.880
random number

0:31:14.640,0:31:19.360
from 1 to 10 and if that number is less

0:31:18.880,0:31:22.720
than

0:31:19.360,0:31:24.720
uh maybe eight so if it picks one two

0:31:22.720,0:31:26.880
three four five six or seven

0:31:24.720,0:31:28.799
so it's drops a good item but if it

0:31:26.880,0:31:31.519
picks eight nine or ten

0:31:28.799,0:31:32.880
then drop a bad item right so if you run

0:31:31.519,0:31:34.399
it now

0:31:32.880,0:31:36.399
uh what should happen is it should drop

0:31:34.399,0:31:39.120
your good items and

0:31:36.399,0:31:40.159
it's making the bad items it is working

0:31:39.120,0:31:41.919
the code is working

0:31:40.159,0:31:43.360
um but they're they're not they don't

0:31:41.919,0:31:46.559
have any code yet right

0:31:43.360,0:31:49.840
so let's do this let's stop it

0:31:46.559,0:31:51.760
and let's see the bad items work now we

0:31:49.840,0:31:53.279
could write the code from scratch on the

0:31:51.760,0:31:55.200
bad item

0:31:53.279,0:31:57.200
but the code from the good item is so

0:31:55.200,0:31:58.799
similar that we should definitely just

0:31:57.200,0:31:59.440
use it to start with so here's what i'm

0:31:58.799,0:32:01.840
going to do

0:31:59.440,0:32:04.320
i'm going to take my good item code and

0:32:01.840,0:32:05.679
i'm just going to drag it over

0:32:04.320,0:32:06.880
and i'm going to drop it right on the

0:32:05.679,0:32:09.279
bad item you can see that kind of

0:32:06.880,0:32:11.039
wiggles when you get it on there

0:32:09.279,0:32:13.440
what that does is that just makes a copy

0:32:11.039,0:32:15.039
of it so now i've got my good item code

0:32:13.440,0:32:17.120
and then i come over here to my bad item

0:32:15.039,0:32:19.600
code and my bad item code

0:32:17.120,0:32:21.600
looks just the same it's kind of funny

0:32:19.600,0:32:22.240
how to the similar or how similar the

0:32:21.600,0:32:24.880
two are

0:32:22.240,0:32:26.720
really the only thing that changes is if

0:32:24.880,0:32:28.640
you're touching the hero

0:32:26.720,0:32:30.320
instead of scoring a point you want

0:32:28.640,0:32:31.919
something bad to happen

0:32:30.320,0:32:34.159
so i'm just going to temporarily take

0:32:31.919,0:32:35.840
this code out of there

0:32:34.159,0:32:38.799
in fact i can probably just drop it in

0:32:35.840,0:32:38.799
the trash can right

0:32:39.679,0:32:43.120
and i'm going to run it and see what

0:32:41.039,0:32:46.159
happens so now the bad item

0:32:43.120,0:32:48.799
should fall just like good items

0:32:46.159,0:32:49.600
the only difference is it won't score a

0:32:48.799,0:32:51.919
point right

0:32:49.600,0:32:53.039
it's like there i got the bad item but

0:32:51.919,0:32:55.760
nothing really happened

0:32:53.039,0:32:57.200
when i hit the bad item it just kind of

0:32:55.760,0:32:59.760
kept falling through me

0:32:57.200,0:33:01.200
now we've also got this problem of the

0:32:59.760,0:33:03.919
original bad item

0:33:01.200,0:33:05.760
is still just sitting on the screen see

0:33:03.919,0:33:06.880
if you can fix that problem all by

0:33:05.760,0:33:08.480
yourself

0:33:06.880,0:33:10.320
all right so i'm going to do what i had

0:33:08.480,0:33:10.799
to do really was just select the donut

0:33:10.320,0:33:13.360
and just

0:33:10.799,0:33:14.880
hide the original and so now there is no

0:33:13.360,0:33:17.600
original

0:33:14.880,0:33:18.559
so the donut doesn't do anything bad

0:33:17.600,0:33:20.159
when i hit it

0:33:18.559,0:33:22.559
so what i want to do is when i hit the

0:33:20.159,0:33:24.799
donut i want stuff to happen

0:33:22.559,0:33:26.320
since i want the whole game to stop

0:33:24.799,0:33:28.080
that's an excellent opportunity for us

0:33:26.320,0:33:29.600
to broadcast an event we've actually

0:33:28.080,0:33:32.640
learned about that before

0:33:29.600,0:33:34.960
it's over in events

0:33:32.640,0:33:38.320
and where it says broadcast message one

0:33:34.960,0:33:39.919
i want to drag this into my if statement

0:33:38.320,0:33:41.360
and instead of calling it message one

0:33:39.919,0:33:44.799
i'm going to give it a new

0:33:41.360,0:33:48.159
name so i'm going to say new message

0:33:44.799,0:33:51.279
and i'm going to type in a game over

0:33:48.159,0:33:53.120
so a broadcast message is really just

0:33:51.279,0:33:56.480
like somebody screams

0:33:53.120,0:33:59.840
game over right so whenever the

0:33:56.480,0:34:02.880
bad item touches the hero he screams

0:33:59.840,0:34:06.559
game over and everybody listens right

0:34:02.880,0:34:08.079
everybody listens everywhere this sprite

0:34:06.559,0:34:08.800
is going to listen for it so he's going

0:34:08.079,0:34:12.000
to have a

0:34:08.800,0:34:13.599
when i receive game over

0:34:12.000,0:34:15.119
and everybody is going to have but when

0:34:13.599,0:34:17.599
i receive game members so they all do

0:34:15.119,0:34:19.359
something including the stage

0:34:17.599,0:34:20.879
the first thing they're going to do when

0:34:19.359,0:34:22.879
they receive game over is they're gonna

0:34:20.879,0:34:23.919
stop their normal script that's a pretty

0:34:22.879,0:34:27.679
common thing

0:34:23.919,0:34:29.280
so that's in control near the bottom

0:34:27.679,0:34:31.520
and i find this a little confusing about

0:34:29.280,0:34:34.159
scratch it's the one that says stop all

0:34:31.520,0:34:35.599
and then you switch it to stop other

0:34:34.159,0:34:38.000
scripts in the sprite so

0:34:35.599,0:34:38.800
basically means once i receive game over

0:34:38.000,0:34:41.280
stop doing

0:34:38.800,0:34:42.399
whatever there was over here and i could

0:34:41.280,0:34:44.960
add that code

0:34:42.399,0:34:45.839
to to everybody i'm going to add it to

0:34:44.960,0:34:47.760
the good item

0:34:45.839,0:34:50.000
i'm going to add it to the hero i'm

0:34:47.760,0:34:51.119
going to add it to the stage everybody

0:34:50.000,0:34:52.639
kind of needs to do that much what the

0:34:51.119,0:34:54.399
heck i'll go ahead and do it now so i'm

0:34:52.639,0:34:57.680
going to drag it from here

0:34:54.399,0:34:59.520
drop it on the hero drop it on the good

0:34:57.680,0:35:01.760
item

0:34:59.520,0:35:03.119
and drop it on the stage i think it's

0:35:01.760,0:35:04.560
kind of cool how many people

0:35:03.119,0:35:06.000
uh there are with code in this i'm gonna

0:35:04.560,0:35:06.800
make sure that everybody's got that much

0:35:06.000,0:35:09.520
code

0:35:06.800,0:35:11.520
so my hero avery she's got it so

0:35:09.520,0:35:13.760
whenever she hears game over

0:35:11.520,0:35:14.960
she stops what she was doing uh that

0:35:13.760,0:35:19.359
that does that

0:35:14.960,0:35:19.359
the good item stops what they were doing

0:35:19.520,0:35:24.720
uh the stage even the stage has to stop

0:35:23.200,0:35:27.359
what the stage was doing so

0:35:24.720,0:35:28.000
every single sprite stops what they were

0:35:27.359,0:35:31.520
doing

0:35:28.000,0:35:33.119
and then they might do some other things

0:35:31.520,0:35:34.880
all right so let's try our code right

0:35:33.119,0:35:36.079
now uh and just kind of see what happens

0:35:34.880,0:35:38.800
uh so if i

0:35:36.079,0:35:39.280
collect uh good items so like tacos are

0:35:38.800,0:35:41.839
good

0:35:39.280,0:35:43.280
i get points but if i hit a doughnut so

0:35:41.839,0:35:46.160
i'm gonna hit a donut right here

0:35:43.280,0:35:46.640
um it just kind of freezes everything

0:35:46.160,0:35:48.240
now

0:35:46.640,0:35:50.000
interestingly everything freezes but

0:35:48.240,0:35:50.480
like it doesn't feel like the game was

0:35:50.000,0:35:53.040
over

0:35:50.480,0:35:54.320
so let's add like a sound effect uh or

0:35:53.040,0:35:55.920
something like that just to kind of let

0:35:54.320,0:35:58.079
people know it's it's game over

0:35:55.920,0:35:59.760
we have to decide who's gonna do that uh

0:35:58.079,0:36:02.000
we could have the hero do it we could

0:35:59.760,0:36:04.079
have the good item or bad iron do it

0:36:02.000,0:36:05.680
i think i'm gonna go to the stage so i'm

0:36:04.079,0:36:07.839
gonna go over to the stage

0:36:05.680,0:36:10.160
and i have the the stage kind of play

0:36:07.839,0:36:12.400
the the game over sound effect

0:36:10.160,0:36:13.920
so i'm gonna go into his sound um and

0:36:12.400,0:36:15.440
i'm going to look for a sound so i'm

0:36:13.920,0:36:20.000
going to click on choose a sound

0:36:15.440,0:36:22.240
i'm going to use the sound drum boing

0:36:20.000,0:36:24.800
um obviously you could pick a different

0:36:22.240,0:36:27.280
sound but i think drum bowing

0:36:24.800,0:36:28.320
um i think that that conveys the message

0:36:27.280,0:36:30.880
uh that you just

0:36:28.320,0:36:32.560
hit something you shouldn't have so i

0:36:30.880,0:36:34.240
added that to my sound so now i've got

0:36:32.560,0:36:36.320
drum blowing over there

0:36:34.240,0:36:38.400
then i'm gonna go into code keep in mind

0:36:36.320,0:36:40.000
i'm still on the stage

0:36:38.400,0:36:42.240
and i'm gonna go into sound i'm going to

0:36:40.000,0:36:45.200
say play

0:36:42.240,0:36:47.359
drum boeing what i'm going to do is i'm

0:36:45.200,0:36:48.960
actually just going to start it

0:36:47.359,0:36:52.160
and then i'm going to put on a time

0:36:48.960,0:36:54.240
delay for how long i want to wait

0:36:52.160,0:36:56.000
maybe i'll wait uh i don't know four

0:36:54.240,0:36:58.160
seconds

0:36:56.000,0:37:00.560
so i'm gonna play that boing and then

0:36:58.160,0:37:02.880
i'm gonna freeze for like four seconds

0:37:00.560,0:37:04.000
um and then after that four seconds i'm

0:37:02.880,0:37:07.680
gonna do a stop

0:37:04.000,0:37:08.000
all stop all is good because it'll

0:37:07.680,0:37:10.160
actually

0:37:08.000,0:37:11.920
clear all the sprites off so you'll

0:37:10.160,0:37:13.359
you'll hear this boing

0:37:11.920,0:37:15.040
uh you're gonna wait for about four

0:37:13.359,0:37:16.079
seconds and then you'll you'll clear off

0:37:15.040,0:37:17.280
everything

0:37:16.079,0:37:19.280
so i'm gonna go and try it and see if

0:37:17.280,0:37:23.839
it's working so i run it

0:37:19.280,0:37:23.839
i collect food um and it uh

0:37:24.160,0:37:27.680
now you can see that there's a little

0:37:25.280,0:37:30.160
bug of my food um

0:37:27.680,0:37:32.160
stayed on me for a little bit boing um

0:37:30.160,0:37:32.960
and then my game uh should end after

0:37:32.160,0:37:34.960
four seconds

0:37:32.960,0:37:36.240
four seconds felt a little long for me

0:37:34.960,0:37:37.680
maybe i'll do like

0:37:36.240,0:37:39.359
two seconds or three seconds or

0:37:37.680,0:37:42.160
something like that

0:37:39.359,0:37:44.240
great so i think that mine might be done

0:37:42.160,0:37:46.079
so i'm going to run it again here

0:37:44.240,0:37:47.280
collecting food so things that i should

0:37:46.079,0:37:50.160
eat for dinner

0:37:47.280,0:37:52.720
trying to catch my dinner and then if i

0:37:50.160,0:37:55.200
hit a donut

0:37:52.720,0:37:57.200
i get a boing and then i get a game over

0:37:55.200,0:37:59.760
cool

0:37:57.200,0:38:00.640
my game is done i'm going to choose to

0:37:59.760,0:38:03.920
click on

0:38:00.640,0:38:06.320
see project page um and i'm gonna

0:38:03.920,0:38:07.359
share it with other people now i've got

0:38:06.320,0:38:09.200
this url

0:38:07.359,0:38:10.480
uh that i could give to my grandparents

0:38:09.200,0:38:12.240
or things like that

0:38:10.480,0:38:13.920
by the way you can also put instructions

0:38:12.240,0:38:16.160
in here uh if you'd like to try to make

0:38:13.920,0:38:18.880
people uh know how to play your game

0:38:16.160,0:38:20.000
but i think mine is a done game so i'm

0:38:18.880,0:38:22.240
going to uh

0:38:20.000,0:38:23.680
see how my campers did all right neela

0:38:22.240,0:38:26.480
you're up first so what theme do you

0:38:23.680,0:38:29.119
have on your game today

0:38:26.480,0:38:31.440
oh you've got a dog that looks like our

0:38:29.119,0:38:32.880
dog neela

0:38:31.440,0:38:34.880
and then the dog you played again hit

0:38:32.880,0:38:37.920
the green flag again

0:38:34.880,0:38:40.079
what's the dog catching mila

0:38:37.920,0:38:41.599

0:40:31.920,0:40:38.800
yes you're a pterodactyl

0:40:36.960,0:40:40.160
all right well we hope you uh enjoyed

0:40:38.800,0:40:42.000
making a game today

0:40:40.160,0:40:43.599
uh we learned a lot of things like

0:40:42.000,0:40:46.720
changing x and y's

0:40:43.599,0:40:47.680
uh creating clones was our big thing um

0:40:46.720,0:40:48.880
and so that's it

0:40:47.680,0:40:50.960
uh hopefully you kind of learned the

0:40:48.880,0:40:52.000
main message that coding's fun uh you

0:40:50.960,0:40:53.680
can do this

0:40:52.000,0:40:56.000
and it really makes a lot of sense to

0:40:53.680,0:40:58.000
use like this one sprite

0:40:56.000,0:40:59.839
with lots of clones of it then that way

0:40:58.000,0:41:01.440
you can reuse the same code

0:40:59.839,0:41:04.400
instead of having to make lots of copies

0:41:01.440,0:41:06.319
of code alright we'll see you next time

0:41:04.400,0:41:08.000
friday i promise is a little shorter

0:41:06.319,0:41:09.520
hopefully you enjoy it

0:41:08.000,0:41:11.440
we're gonna see if we can convince

0:41:09.520,0:41:12.319
mckinley to lead the show tomorrow so it

0:41:11.440,0:41:20.480
should be fun

0:41:12.319,0:41:20.480
all right see you then bye
