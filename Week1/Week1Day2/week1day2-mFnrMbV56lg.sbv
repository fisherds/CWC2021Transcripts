[Music]

0:00:04.560,0:00:07.359
hey hey

0:00:05.120,0:00:09.280
welcome back it's day number two of our

0:00:07.359,0:00:10.559
coding camp uh i'm here with my campers

0:00:09.280,0:00:12.160
again i'll let them introduce themselves

0:00:10.559,0:00:15.839
again

0:00:12.160,0:00:18.800
hi i'm bowen hi i'm keegan

0:00:15.839,0:00:20.160
hi i'm mckinley all right and we are uh

0:00:18.800,0:00:21.439
back and we're going to do some coding

0:00:20.160,0:00:23.680
activities today

0:00:21.439,0:00:24.960
uh before we get jumped into uh today

0:00:23.680,0:00:26.480
though i just want to quickly

0:00:24.960,0:00:27.840
reflect on some things we learned last

0:00:26.480,0:00:29.199
time it's a really good way to kind of

0:00:27.840,0:00:29.760
like submit some of these things in your

0:00:29.199,0:00:31.519
head

0:00:29.760,0:00:34.079
so things we learned last time so we did

0:00:31.519,0:00:35.520
avery uh with our alphabet breakfast

0:00:34.079,0:00:37.680
one thing we learned is that different

0:00:35.520,0:00:38.960
sprites have their own codes like avery

0:00:37.680,0:00:40.960
had some code

0:00:38.960,0:00:42.160
and then the apple had some code today

0:00:40.960,0:00:43.360
we're going to multiple sprites but

0:00:42.160,0:00:44.640
actually only one of them is going to

0:00:43.360,0:00:46.800
have code

0:00:44.640,0:00:48.079
other things we learned is that code

0:00:46.800,0:00:49.840
happens sequentially

0:00:48.079,0:00:51.680
so you do things in order so this is

0:00:49.840,0:00:53.280
like point towards mouse pointer move

0:00:51.680,0:00:54.559
these steps change this costume it

0:00:53.280,0:00:56.559
happens sequentially

0:00:54.559,0:00:58.320
we also use a lot of loops to make

0:00:56.559,0:00:59.280
things happen sequentially over and over

0:00:58.320,0:01:01.120
again

0:00:59.280,0:01:03.039
we learned about if statements so maybe

0:01:01.120,0:01:04.559
this thing happens maybe it doesn't but

0:01:03.039,0:01:05.840
if statements are something we use a lot

0:01:04.559,0:01:07.200
in our code

0:01:05.840,0:01:09.280
and then the last thing we learned about

0:01:07.200,0:01:10.720
was variables so last time we learned

0:01:09.280,0:01:11.680
about variables you had to create the

0:01:10.720,0:01:13.760
variable

0:01:11.680,0:01:15.439
you usually would initialize it you

0:01:13.760,0:01:16.960
would regularly modify a variable

0:01:15.439,0:01:19.119
because it's got to change if it's a

0:01:16.960,0:01:21.119
variable right and then you have to use

0:01:19.119,0:01:22.720
it somehow in your program

0:01:21.119,0:01:24.560
and so those are some skills we learned

0:01:22.720,0:01:25.280
last time and we're going to learn new

0:01:24.560,0:01:27.280
skills

0:01:25.280,0:01:28.479
this time let's show you a demo of what

0:01:27.280,0:01:30.079
we're making today

0:01:28.479,0:01:32.159
so i've got a demo solution on here that

0:01:30.079,0:01:33.920
i can show you

0:01:32.159,0:01:35.520
and so we're making a game called

0:01:33.920,0:01:37.439
hedgehog snack

0:01:35.520,0:01:38.640
so i'm going to make it full screen and

0:01:37.439,0:01:40.960
hit play

0:01:38.640,0:01:42.560
but what this is is this is a hedgehog

0:01:40.960,0:01:43.280
um and he's trying to get around the

0:01:42.560,0:01:45.280
maze

0:01:43.280,0:01:46.640
uh and you use the arrow keys to move

0:01:45.280,0:01:49.040
him around the maze

0:01:46.640,0:01:50.640
um and if you run into a wall um he he

0:01:49.040,0:01:52.240
won't go in the walls right so he just

0:01:50.640,0:01:55.040
bumps off the walls

0:01:52.240,0:01:56.399
um and then he is trying to uh get the

0:01:55.040,0:01:58.320
beetle

0:01:56.399,0:02:00.079
when he gets the beetle he chomps uh and

0:01:58.320,0:02:00.960
he says congratulations for finding the

0:02:00.079,0:02:02.880
beetle

0:02:00.960,0:02:06.479
we're also going to add a feature to our

0:02:02.880,0:02:08.479
game so this is another version of it

0:02:06.479,0:02:09.840
so almost the exact same game but in

0:02:08.479,0:02:12.640
this one we're gonna add a

0:02:09.840,0:02:13.599
timer so it's gonna be how fast can you

0:02:12.640,0:02:15.760
get the beetle

0:02:13.599,0:02:17.040
uh so you hit him um and he'll say you

0:02:15.760,0:02:20.480
found the beetle in

0:02:17.040,0:02:22.800
6.5 seconds and then your goal is to try

0:02:20.480,0:02:24.640
to be faster i was 6.5 last time do you

0:02:22.800,0:02:28.160
think i could be faster this time

0:02:24.640,0:02:31.440
come on hedgehog i was

0:02:28.160,0:02:32.640
5.7 right so that's the idea of our game

0:02:31.440,0:02:34.720
today

0:02:32.640,0:02:36.319
so let's go ahead and get started uh by

0:02:34.720,0:02:39.599
clicking on um

0:02:36.319,0:02:40.640
or go to scratch.mit.edu i'll go there

0:02:39.599,0:02:43.920
as well

0:02:40.640,0:02:46.800
and click on create up here

0:02:43.920,0:02:47.120
so we've got a blank screen we've got a

0:02:46.800,0:02:49.200
cat

0:02:47.120,0:02:50.480
on our screen the first thing that i

0:02:49.200,0:02:52.160
want to do is i want to get rid of the

0:02:50.480,0:02:53.680
cat we don't have a cat in our program

0:02:52.160,0:02:55.599
so go ahead and delete the cat for

0:02:53.680,0:02:57.680
trashcan icon here

0:02:55.599,0:02:58.879
and let's go ahead and add our hedgehog

0:02:57.680,0:03:02.159
so just like we did before

0:02:58.879,0:03:03.599
i click on choose a sprite

0:03:02.159,0:03:05.760
and the sprite that we're going to pick

0:03:03.599,0:03:06.800
is an animal

0:03:05.760,0:03:08.640
and the one i'm looking for is the

0:03:06.800,0:03:10.400
hedgehog so i'm just going to go through

0:03:08.640,0:03:12.319
here and pick the hedgehog

0:03:10.400,0:03:13.840
now yesterday i said try to use avery

0:03:12.319,0:03:15.200
walking but a bunch of my campers here

0:03:13.840,0:03:16.720
use something different anyway

0:03:15.200,0:03:18.640
i will say that if you want to use a

0:03:16.720,0:03:19.360
different sprite it'll work out okay

0:03:18.640,0:03:20.720
this time

0:03:19.360,0:03:23.280
but i'm going to use a hedgehog because

0:03:20.720,0:03:26.400
that's the way i design this game

0:03:23.280,0:03:29.519
so now we've got our hedgehog in here

0:03:26.400,0:03:32.159
our hedgehog is a certain size

0:03:29.519,0:03:34.400
as you can see the size of our hedgehog

0:03:32.159,0:03:37.280
affects how complex our maze can be

0:03:34.400,0:03:38.879
right so if you want a very simple maze

0:03:37.280,0:03:40.560
100 hedgehog work

0:03:38.879,0:03:42.319
but you can see that like about all i

0:03:40.560,0:03:43.360
could do is like maybe a u-shape if he's

0:03:42.319,0:03:44.480
100

0:03:43.360,0:03:46.480
so i'm going to make mine a little

0:03:44.480,0:03:47.280
smaller i'm going to make them like 50

0:03:46.480,0:03:48.720
percent

0:03:47.280,0:03:50.400
and now you can see that i could make a

0:03:48.720,0:03:52.720
more intricate maze

0:03:50.400,0:03:54.000
if i wanted to do that so pick the size

0:03:52.720,0:03:55.760
of your hedgehog

0:03:54.000,0:03:57.760
that you think is appropriate for you i

0:03:55.760,0:03:58.879
would guess somewhere like 40 to 60 type

0:03:57.760,0:04:00.319
range

0:03:58.879,0:04:03.439
the next thing i want to do is i want to

0:04:00.319,0:04:05.280
control how my hedgehog moves

0:04:03.439,0:04:07.439
so just like before if you click on

0:04:05.280,0:04:09.760
direction you can see that this hedgehog

0:04:07.439,0:04:11.200
can point uh any direction right

0:04:09.760,0:04:13.599
and so that's just how these sprites

0:04:11.200,0:04:15.200
work but what i want to do

0:04:13.599,0:04:16.799
is in this game i never want him to

0:04:15.200,0:04:19.199
point a weird direction

0:04:16.799,0:04:20.720
um and so i want to set his mode so you

0:04:19.199,0:04:22.240
can see his modes there's three modes

0:04:20.720,0:04:24.639
there's all around

0:04:22.240,0:04:26.080
there's left right um and then there's

0:04:24.639,0:04:28.960
do not rotate

0:04:26.080,0:04:30.320
so click on do not rotate um and so the

0:04:28.960,0:04:32.160
nice thing about do not rotate

0:04:30.320,0:04:34.080
is it doesn't actually matter which way

0:04:32.160,0:04:34.880
you point this arrow because he does not

0:04:34.080,0:04:37.919
rotate

0:04:34.880,0:04:39.840
um because i'm just a little ocd i'm

0:04:37.919,0:04:42.000
going to put him back to 90

0:04:39.840,0:04:43.440
but it genuinely doesn't matter where

0:04:42.000,0:04:45.440
you leave it but i like to leave mine at

0:04:43.440,0:04:47.840
90.

0:04:45.440,0:04:49.280
great so now we've got a hedgehog we've

0:04:47.840,0:04:50.960
also got to make

0:04:49.280,0:04:53.440
a drawing of the background i'm going to

0:04:50.960,0:04:56.000
put the code in for the hedgehog first

0:04:53.440,0:04:57.360
so whenever we start our code i'm going

0:04:56.000,0:04:58.720
to move the hedgehog to where i want him

0:04:57.360,0:05:00.400
to start my game

0:04:58.720,0:05:02.880
i'm going to make him start i'll make

0:05:00.400,0:05:04.160
him start in the upper left here

0:05:02.880,0:05:06.160
it doesn't really matter but i'm going

0:05:04.160,0:05:07.840
to put him in the upper left and i'm

0:05:06.160,0:05:09.120
going to start making code for my

0:05:07.840,0:05:10.800
hedgehog

0:05:09.120,0:05:12.240
so campers what's the first command that

0:05:10.800,0:05:16.720
we usually put into our code

0:05:12.240,0:05:19.360
to start things off yeah so go to events

0:05:16.720,0:05:20.160
and the way a lot of programs start is

0:05:19.360,0:05:25.280
with

0:05:20.160,0:05:27.919
when green flag clicks

0:05:25.280,0:05:29.360
and so once i click the green flag i

0:05:27.919,0:05:31.280
want to do something i want to make sure

0:05:29.360,0:05:32.479
that he snaps back to this starting

0:05:31.280,0:05:34.240
position

0:05:32.479,0:05:35.600
so to make sure that he snaps back to

0:05:34.240,0:05:36.400
the starting position that's going to be

0:05:35.600,0:05:39.600
in movement

0:05:36.400,0:05:42.800
so go to movement

0:05:39.600,0:05:45.840
and find one that says go to x

0:05:42.800,0:05:47.440
y uh so it's this one right here the

0:05:45.840,0:05:49.360
thing i really like about this command

0:05:47.440,0:05:50.160
is that if i move my hedgehog to this

0:05:49.360,0:05:52.639
position

0:05:50.160,0:05:54.240
first then the it's called the arguments

0:05:52.639,0:05:56.560
so the numbers in white here

0:05:54.240,0:05:57.600
are set to wherever i move my hedgehog

0:05:56.560,0:05:59.840
if yours

0:05:57.600,0:06:00.720
um is different numbers that's totally

0:05:59.840,0:06:02.080
fine um

0:06:00.720,0:06:03.199
they'll they'll be corresponding to

0:06:02.080,0:06:04.240
where he's at right now by the way you

0:06:03.199,0:06:05.680
can see that

0:06:04.240,0:06:07.360
because you can see his x and his wire

0:06:05.680,0:06:08.720
down here and they should match just

0:06:07.360,0:06:11.280
perfectly

0:06:08.720,0:06:12.479
the next thing i want to do is i want to

0:06:11.280,0:06:14.880
have my hedgehog do

0:06:12.479,0:06:17.840
things forever a very common thing to do

0:06:14.880,0:06:17.840
so go to control

0:06:18.000,0:06:23.440
and find the forever loop so very mean

0:06:21.199,0:06:25.520
to tell humans to do things forever

0:06:23.440,0:06:28.479
but in code it happens all the time

0:06:25.520,0:06:30.880
we're going to forever do things

0:06:28.479,0:06:31.840
so what are we going to do forever well

0:06:30.880,0:06:34.639
we're going to

0:06:31.840,0:06:36.720
listen for a user to press the up down

0:06:34.639,0:06:38.960
left and right arrow keys

0:06:36.720,0:06:40.319
and whenever they press those keys we're

0:06:38.960,0:06:41.680
going to move in that direction does

0:06:40.319,0:06:45.440
that make sense

0:06:41.680,0:06:48.479
so let's go ahead and stub out

0:06:45.440,0:06:52.319
four if statements so one

0:06:48.479,0:06:53.360
two three four

0:06:52.319,0:06:56.960
so you can see that we're going to have

0:06:53.360,0:06:59.120
four keys up down left and right

0:06:56.960,0:07:00.720
and inside of each one of these there's

0:06:59.120,0:07:02.720
a condition

0:07:00.720,0:07:04.639
and then there's code that runs if that

0:07:02.720,0:07:08.479
condition is true

0:07:04.639,0:07:10.000
a lot of conditions are inside sensing

0:07:08.479,0:07:14.000
so for this condition that's on the

0:07:10.000,0:07:14.000
inside go to sensing

0:07:14.240,0:07:18.240
and we want to know if they're pressing

0:07:16.479,0:07:19.599
a key or not

0:07:18.240,0:07:21.520
so the one that we want is this one

0:07:19.599,0:07:24.080
right here um

0:07:21.520,0:07:25.199
key space pressed so go ahead and put

0:07:24.080,0:07:27.280
this in here

0:07:25.199,0:07:28.479
now obviously you don't care about the

0:07:27.280,0:07:31.039
space bar

0:07:28.479,0:07:32.720
what you care about is a different key

0:07:31.039,0:07:34.160
that's where this little white drop down

0:07:32.720,0:07:35.440
comes into play so click on this white

0:07:34.160,0:07:38.800
drop down

0:07:35.440,0:07:39.840
and make it say up arrow so i'm going to

0:07:38.800,0:07:42.639
let you finish

0:07:39.840,0:07:44.639
the other three so go ahead and do that

0:07:42.639,0:07:47.360
same trick put a space in

0:07:44.639,0:07:48.479
for up while we've already got up down

0:07:47.360,0:07:51.120
left and right

0:07:48.479,0:07:52.560
so go ahead and finish that up all right

0:07:51.120,0:07:54.479
so i've got mine in there if you did

0:07:52.560,0:07:56.240
yours in a different order that's okay

0:07:54.479,0:07:57.919
the order doesn't actually matter

0:07:56.240,0:07:59.840
um but now we're going to put things

0:07:57.919,0:08:00.960
into them so we're going to do the same

0:07:59.840,0:08:02.240
thing we're going to do

0:08:00.960,0:08:06.240
one together then i'm going to let you

0:08:02.240,0:08:09.120
make the rest so go into motion

0:08:06.240,0:08:11.680
and we want to do two things we want to

0:08:09.120,0:08:14.560
point in a certain direction

0:08:11.680,0:08:14.560
so let's find

0:08:14.720,0:08:21.680
point uh where is it at uh point in

0:08:17.919,0:08:21.680
direction 90. there's the one

0:08:22.319,0:08:26.000
now where it says 90 this is kind of fun

0:08:25.120,0:08:28.080
uh what direction

0:08:26.000,0:08:29.360
is 90 you can actually just click on the

0:08:28.080,0:08:30.720
number 90

0:08:29.360,0:08:33.120
and it'll show you what direction it

0:08:30.720,0:08:34.640
considers 90. so 90 is apparently

0:08:33.120,0:08:36.479
straight over to the right

0:08:34.640,0:08:38.839
well if we press the up arrow i want to

0:08:36.479,0:08:41.839
go up so i want that arrow to go

0:08:38.839,0:08:42.640
up and then after i point in that

0:08:41.839,0:08:47.360
direction

0:08:42.640,0:08:47.360
i want to move 10 steps

0:08:47.680,0:08:51.200
so maybe you see the pattern already but

0:08:49.360,0:08:55.680
i'll do one more with you

0:08:51.200,0:08:58.959
so i find a point in direction 90.

0:08:55.680,0:09:00.800
i click on the 90 and i make it the

0:08:58.959,0:09:02.320
direction that the arrow says so this is

0:09:00.800,0:09:05.519
a down arrow

0:09:02.320,0:09:09.279
so i want it to be down

0:09:05.519,0:09:10.800
and then i grab a move 10 steps

0:09:09.279,0:09:13.680
so see if you can finish the other two

0:09:10.800,0:09:15.120
up for left and right

0:09:13.680,0:09:16.399
all right so i got mine in there

0:09:15.120,0:09:17.040
actually it turns out that i did the

0:09:16.399,0:09:19.040
easy two

0:09:17.040,0:09:20.160
up and down my campers had a little more

0:09:19.040,0:09:21.519
problems with uh

0:09:20.160,0:09:22.880
with left and right just people didn't

0:09:21.519,0:09:24.480
know they're left and right so left is

0:09:22.880,0:09:26.560
over that way which is negative 90 and

0:09:24.480,0:09:29.600
right is that which is positive 90.

0:09:26.560,0:09:31.040
um go ahead and try it out uh and see

0:09:29.600,0:09:31.519
how it goes so go ahead and hit your

0:09:31.040,0:09:33.680
green

0:09:31.519,0:09:35.440
uh flag button um and if you press your

0:09:33.680,0:09:37.279
down arrow it should go down

0:09:35.440,0:09:39.040
your right arrow should go right up

0:09:37.279,0:09:40.240
should go up left should go left and so

0:09:39.040,0:09:41.519
now you kind of move around

0:09:40.240,0:09:43.120
you can also kind of sort of do

0:09:41.519,0:09:45.040
diagonals if you hold down two keys at

0:09:43.120,0:09:48.000
the same time

0:09:45.040,0:09:49.760
now the speed might feel like it's just

0:09:48.000,0:09:51.200
fine right now

0:09:49.760,0:09:53.600
but that's because there's no walls in

0:09:51.200,0:09:55.920
the way this actually is kind of a fast

0:09:53.600,0:09:57.440
speed and so what we want to do is we

0:09:55.920,0:10:00.320
want to change the speed

0:09:57.440,0:10:02.000
um we're going to make it slower but

0:10:00.320,0:10:03.360
instead of just changing each one you'll

0:10:02.000,0:10:04.079
find that this is annoying so it's like

0:10:03.360,0:10:05.519
oh maybe

0:10:04.079,0:10:06.880
seven is the right number so i'd change

0:10:05.519,0:10:08.000
them all to seven you don't have to do

0:10:06.880,0:10:09.200
that right

0:10:08.000,0:10:10.720
and then you run it you're like oh

0:10:09.200,0:10:11.839
that's a little too fast maybe i want

0:10:10.720,0:10:13.200
six

0:10:11.839,0:10:15.360
and you can see how whenever you have

0:10:13.200,0:10:17.519
the same number in your code

0:10:15.360,0:10:19.519
in many different places it's better to

0:10:17.519,0:10:22.320
make a variable

0:10:19.519,0:10:23.519
that is set one time and then you can

0:10:22.320,0:10:25.490
use it everywhere else

0:10:23.519,0:10:27.839
so i go and click on variables

0:10:25.490,0:10:31.519
[Music]

0:10:27.839,0:10:32.720
and click on make a variable

0:10:31.519,0:10:35.920
and we're going to make a variable

0:10:32.720,0:10:38.160
called speed

0:10:35.920,0:10:40.000
now speed is is a different variable

0:10:38.160,0:10:42.160
than like we used last time so last time

0:10:40.000,0:10:44.000
we created it we instantiated it we

0:10:42.160,0:10:46.480
modified it we read it

0:10:44.000,0:10:48.160
this one is actually a variable called

0:10:46.480,0:10:49.600
speed that's going to be a constant

0:10:48.160,0:10:51.600
um so we're going to set it once and

0:10:49.600,0:10:53.279
we're going to use it multiple places

0:10:51.600,0:10:55.920
it can be for all sprites and that's

0:10:53.279,0:10:56.959
fine but it's actually specific to just

0:10:55.920,0:10:59.200
the hedgehog

0:10:56.959,0:11:00.880
so i'm going to click on for this sprite

0:10:59.200,0:11:03.279
only because only

0:11:00.880,0:11:06.399
the hedgehog needs to know his speed so

0:11:03.279,0:11:08.000
i'm going to click on ok

0:11:06.399,0:11:10.560
now whenever you put it in here you can

0:11:08.000,0:11:11.920
see mine says hedgehog colon speed i

0:11:10.560,0:11:12.800
actually i don't want to display it on

0:11:11.920,0:11:13.920
the screen

0:11:12.800,0:11:15.040
whenever you don't want to display a

0:11:13.920,0:11:17.519
variable on the screen just hit this

0:11:15.040,0:11:19.120
little check box beside it

0:11:17.519,0:11:20.640
so there's no need to display it on the

0:11:19.120,0:11:22.560
screen we don't really want that so we

0:11:20.640,0:11:24.480
just uncheck that

0:11:22.560,0:11:25.600
now we will need to do the the other

0:11:24.480,0:11:28.399
normal task

0:11:25.600,0:11:29.760
so we need to set my speed somewhere at

0:11:28.399,0:11:32.959
the top

0:11:29.760,0:11:34.800
so drop in this set now you'll notice it

0:11:32.959,0:11:36.000
defaulted to my variable that's not the

0:11:34.800,0:11:39.760
one i wanted

0:11:36.000,0:11:41.680
i want speed by the way if you're

0:11:39.760,0:11:42.959
annoyed about this variable called my

0:11:41.680,0:11:44.800
variable that's still around

0:11:42.959,0:11:46.480
you can this is completely optional you

0:11:44.800,0:11:48.480
can right click on it

0:11:46.480,0:11:50.079
and you can delete my variable if you

0:11:48.480,0:11:51.040
want and then it goes away because we

0:11:50.079,0:11:52.720
don't need it

0:11:51.040,0:11:55.360
so i'm going to set my speed to

0:11:52.720,0:11:59.200
something i'm going to set it to

0:11:55.360,0:12:01.519
five now the idea is

0:11:59.200,0:12:03.040
we've made the variable which is good

0:12:01.519,0:12:05.760
we've set its value

0:12:03.040,0:12:07.279
to five in this case and then the next

0:12:05.760,0:12:08.959
thing we want to do is we want to use

0:12:07.279,0:12:10.560
this variable in places

0:12:08.959,0:12:11.839
if i run the code now it won't be any

0:12:10.560,0:12:12.639
different there's nothing magic about

0:12:11.839,0:12:14.399
the word speed

0:12:12.639,0:12:16.880
i've got to actually drop this variable

0:12:14.399,0:12:18.959
in to all these places that say move

0:12:16.880,0:12:20.639
so i'm going to drag speed and i'm going

0:12:18.959,0:12:22.240
to drop it into that one

0:12:20.639,0:12:23.760
and i'm going to grab speed and drop it

0:12:22.240,0:12:25.040
into that one

0:12:23.760,0:12:28.959
i think you see the pattern go ahead and

0:12:25.040,0:12:32.639
hit the last two speed

0:12:28.959,0:12:34.800
and speed

0:12:32.639,0:12:36.240
cool so now the fun thing about this is

0:12:34.800,0:12:38.560
while i'm developing

0:12:36.240,0:12:39.440
i can try five and i can see how five

0:12:38.560,0:12:41.120
works

0:12:39.440,0:12:43.200
um and i'm actually happy enough with

0:12:41.120,0:12:44.240
five but if five wasn't good i could

0:12:43.200,0:12:45.839
change into something different let's

0:12:44.240,0:12:47.760
say i wanted four even right

0:12:45.839,0:12:49.760
so maybe i've got a really intricate

0:12:47.760,0:12:51.120
maze um and i need to like go a little

0:12:49.760,0:12:52.959
slower through it

0:12:51.120,0:12:54.959
but it's nice to do things like this

0:12:52.959,0:12:55.760
because then you can set it in only one

0:12:54.959,0:12:57.279
place

0:12:55.760,0:12:59.040
and then you can use it and all these

0:12:57.279,0:13:00.560
different things it's called avoiding

0:12:59.040,0:13:03.360
magic numbers

0:13:00.560,0:13:05.360
all right little digress there alright

0:13:03.360,0:13:07.600
so i'm pretty happy with

0:13:05.360,0:13:10.560
our hedgehog i think what i really want

0:13:07.600,0:13:12.720
to do next is i want to get into drawing

0:13:10.560,0:13:14.079
so i'm going to hop over to the solution

0:13:12.720,0:13:15.920
just kind of see it again

0:13:14.079,0:13:17.839
you can see that what we have to do here

0:13:15.920,0:13:20.880
is we have to draw a maze

0:13:17.839,0:13:23.920
for our hedgehog to go around to get to

0:13:20.880,0:13:25.279
his goal so the way i drew this maze

0:13:23.920,0:13:28.880
there's many ways to draw it

0:13:25.279,0:13:30.639
is i made a solid like dark brown

0:13:28.880,0:13:32.240
that filled up the whole screen so it's

0:13:30.639,0:13:32.880
actually a rectangle it's solid it's

0:13:32.240,0:13:34.399
dark brown

0:13:32.880,0:13:36.079
maybe i'll just go in and look at it

0:13:34.399,0:13:37.519
here so it's a solid dark brown

0:13:36.079,0:13:39.839
rectangle that feels little screen

0:13:37.519,0:13:40.880
and then i drew a series of light brown

0:13:39.839,0:13:42.800
rectangles

0:13:40.880,0:13:43.920
um on top of it to kind of like make the

0:13:42.800,0:13:45.519
path

0:13:43.920,0:13:46.720
there's many ways to draw but that's

0:13:45.519,0:13:48.399
going to be the strategy that we're

0:13:46.720,0:13:49.760
going to use together

0:13:48.399,0:13:51.760
so go ahead and do this for me let's

0:13:49.760,0:13:52.959
draw our background so the first thing

0:13:51.760,0:13:55.680
you have to do is you have to click over

0:13:52.959,0:13:58.160
here where it says backdrops

0:13:55.680,0:13:58.959
and a backdrop just like sprites i can

0:13:58.160,0:14:01.519
have code

0:13:58.959,0:14:02.800
if you want and then this tab right here

0:14:01.519,0:14:04.079
called backdrops this is where we're

0:14:02.800,0:14:05.519
going to be doing our modifying

0:14:04.079,0:14:06.959
he can also have sounds by the way we

0:14:05.519,0:14:08.240
don't care about sounds for him but we

0:14:06.959,0:14:10.160
do want backdrops

0:14:08.240,0:14:11.519
now before what we did is we just used a

0:14:10.160,0:14:13.600
built-in image

0:14:11.519,0:14:15.760
but this time we're going to draw uh

0:14:13.600,0:14:18.480
from scratch ourselves

0:14:15.760,0:14:20.240
drawing um it's like i don't know

0:14:18.480,0:14:21.760
there's there's like a peppa pig episode

0:14:20.240,0:14:23.600
where like she gets glitter but as soon

0:14:21.760,0:14:24.480
as like kids get glitter they just go

0:14:23.600,0:14:27.440
crazy with that

0:14:24.480,0:14:28.959
somehow it just goes nuts drawing can be

0:14:27.440,0:14:30.959
the same way so make sure you have

0:14:28.959,0:14:32.079
patience with your little ones um but

0:14:30.959,0:14:32.880
what we want to do is we want to do some

0:14:32.079,0:14:34.560
drawing

0:14:32.880,0:14:36.880
let's get you familiar with the drawing

0:14:34.560,0:14:37.920
editor um it's really powerful to get

0:14:36.880,0:14:39.760
good at drawing

0:14:37.920,0:14:41.600
it's kind of like where steam comes in

0:14:39.760,0:14:43.680
it's a combination of art

0:14:41.600,0:14:44.959
and science but you do have to get good

0:14:43.680,0:14:46.480
at your tools so you can see that

0:14:44.959,0:14:48.000
there's a number of different tools

0:14:46.480,0:14:49.920
the one we're going to focus on today is

0:14:48.000,0:14:51.839
the rectangle tool

0:14:49.920,0:14:54.480
and then the select tool so these are

0:14:51.839,0:14:55.600
the only two that we care about today

0:14:54.480,0:14:57.680
so the first thing i want to do is i

0:14:55.600,0:14:59.920
want to draw a big rectangle on here

0:14:57.680,0:15:00.959
for that dark brown color that fills up

0:14:59.920,0:15:03.519
the whole screen

0:15:00.959,0:15:05.519
so what i do is i click on fill color

0:15:03.519,0:15:07.600
mine defaulted to purple for some reason

0:15:05.519,0:15:10.000
and i'm going to try to find uh the

0:15:07.600,0:15:12.240
color that i want for my brown

0:15:10.000,0:15:13.920
their system uses something called um

0:15:12.240,0:15:15.120
color saturation brightness

0:15:13.920,0:15:17.040
which i think might be a little

0:15:15.120,0:15:17.920
confusing for kids uh but but you'll get

0:15:17.040,0:15:19.680
used to it but you

0:15:17.920,0:15:22.079
you pick what color the rainbow you want

0:15:19.680,0:15:24.079
first um then you pick like

0:15:22.079,0:15:25.519
how uh you know like intense you want it

0:15:24.079,0:15:27.120
to be the saturation

0:15:25.519,0:15:30.160
and then you pick the brightness so i'm

0:15:27.120,0:15:32.639
going to make mine kind of like a brown

0:15:30.160,0:15:33.600
the outline i actually don't want an

0:15:32.639,0:15:34.720
outline

0:15:33.600,0:15:37.440
so i'm going to click on this little

0:15:34.720,0:15:39.600
like red line and this means

0:15:37.440,0:15:41.040
don't give me an outline at all right so

0:15:39.600,0:15:41.920
it's like transparent it's like it's not

0:15:41.040,0:15:44.800
there

0:15:41.920,0:15:46.880
so now i'm ready to draw so what i want

0:15:44.800,0:15:49.040
to do is i want to draw a rectangle

0:15:46.880,0:15:51.600
that's just big enough it does not have

0:15:49.040,0:15:53.199
to be perfect to fill the whole screen

0:15:51.600,0:15:54.800
what they've decided to do in scratch is

0:15:53.199,0:15:57.199
that this white box

0:15:54.800,0:15:58.959
this is your screen and anything you

0:15:57.199,0:15:59.839
draw like outside of your screen doesn't

0:15:58.959,0:16:00.959
really matter

0:15:59.839,0:16:03.680
so i'm just going to make it big enough

0:16:00.959,0:16:05.040
to go beyond my screen

0:16:03.680,0:16:06.959
you can see what i'm doing here is after

0:16:05.040,0:16:08.959
you draw a rectangle you

0:16:06.959,0:16:11.040
um go into a mode where you've selected

0:16:08.959,0:16:12.320
that rectangle and you can modify it

0:16:11.040,0:16:14.880
which is kind of neat so i can now

0:16:12.320,0:16:16.240
modify it by grabbing these handles

0:16:14.880,0:16:18.160
that's something that they added by the

0:16:16.240,0:16:18.560
way there's also what's called bitmap

0:16:18.160,0:16:20.000
mode

0:16:18.560,0:16:21.680
we don't want that we want to be able to

0:16:20.000,0:16:22.320
modify our rectangles after we put them

0:16:21.680,0:16:25.360
on

0:16:22.320,0:16:26.639
so that's my big background color the

0:16:25.360,0:16:28.240
next thing i want to do is i want to

0:16:26.639,0:16:31.279
click off of that rectangle

0:16:28.240,0:16:32.160
so by the way if you use the select tool

0:16:31.279,0:16:33.839
you can click on it

0:16:32.160,0:16:35.360
and you can see these blue lines around

0:16:33.839,0:16:36.639
it or you can click off of it

0:16:35.360,0:16:39.120
if you click on it you're going to

0:16:36.639,0:16:40.560
modify it if you click off of it you're

0:16:39.120,0:16:41.519
going to draw something new

0:16:40.560,0:16:44.639
so i'm going to draw some more

0:16:41.519,0:16:45.920
rectangles uh so for mine i'm just going

0:16:44.639,0:16:50.720
to use

0:16:45.920,0:16:51.680
maybe like a lighter brown for his path

0:16:50.720,0:16:53.120
and i'm going to start drawing

0:16:51.680,0:16:54.880
rectangles so i'm going to draw a

0:16:53.120,0:16:58.320
rectangle that kind of comes

0:16:54.880,0:16:59.759
down and then what i choose to do is i

0:16:58.320,0:17:01.120
kind of like click off of it so it's no

0:16:59.759,0:17:02.880
longer selected

0:17:01.120,0:17:04.640
and then i'm going to draw a rectangle

0:17:02.880,0:17:06.160
uh so it's not a very good rectangle

0:17:04.640,0:17:08.160
draw a rectangle that comes like over

0:17:06.160,0:17:10.240
this way

0:17:08.160,0:17:12.079
um and you can choose to make your maze

0:17:10.240,0:17:14.720
as complex or as simple

0:17:12.079,0:17:16.400
as you would like right just make sure

0:17:14.720,0:17:18.640
that you can in fact get through your

0:17:16.400,0:17:20.240
rectangle um

0:17:18.640,0:17:22.480
or else your your game is going to not

0:17:20.240,0:17:24.319
be playable the other nice thing is if

0:17:22.480,0:17:25.199
you decide like oh this is kind of too

0:17:24.319,0:17:26.720
low i'm going to

0:17:25.199,0:17:28.880
move this up you could always move

0:17:26.720,0:17:30.720
things up afterwards so i'm not going to

0:17:28.880,0:17:33.360
tell you what to draw

0:17:30.720,0:17:34.400
it's completely up to you but you can

0:17:33.360,0:17:37.280
make it as

0:17:34.400,0:17:38.640
simple or as complex as you like um i

0:17:37.280,0:17:40.799
don't know why but i felt like making

0:17:38.640,0:17:43.840
mine a little bit more complex this time

0:17:40.799,0:17:46.640
was that a good plan i'm not sure um

0:17:43.840,0:17:48.240
but i chose to make mine kind of complex

0:17:46.640,0:17:51.280
and so you're going to pick

0:17:48.240,0:17:53.919
like where is the end goal of your

0:17:51.280,0:17:56.960
of your maze so for mine my end goal is

0:17:53.919,0:17:56.960
going to be up here at the top

0:17:57.120,0:18:01.360
so i'll make that a little bigger there

0:17:59.039,0:18:04.240
so i'm going to eventually put my beetle

0:18:01.360,0:18:05.840
up here you can also be ocd about

0:18:04.240,0:18:07.520
getting the edges to line up

0:18:05.840,0:18:09.840
it's like this edge is just a little bit

0:18:07.520,0:18:13.280
low there and i can try to get that

0:18:09.840,0:18:14.000
just perfect on there and the nice thing

0:18:13.280,0:18:15.919
about this tool

0:18:14.000,0:18:17.200
is that you can always modify things uh

0:18:15.919,0:18:19.039
after the fact

0:18:17.200,0:18:20.400
so i think that that is probably good

0:18:19.039,0:18:22.640
enough um

0:18:20.400,0:18:24.240
maybe i'll move that up just a little

0:18:22.640,0:18:27.440
and i'll call mine done

0:18:24.240,0:18:28.240
so pause the video and spend as long as

0:18:27.440,0:18:31.440
you need

0:18:28.240,0:18:33.200
uh to draw a maze do keep in mind

0:18:31.440,0:18:34.480
that your hedgehog has to be able to go

0:18:33.200,0:18:35.840
through it um

0:18:34.480,0:18:37.760
so what i'm going to do really quick is

0:18:35.840,0:18:38.960
i'm going to take my hedgehog now so i'm

0:18:37.760,0:18:40.080
actually just going to click on him over

0:18:38.960,0:18:41.520
here

0:18:40.080,0:18:43.200
and i'm going to make sure that he fits

0:18:41.520,0:18:44.720
everywhere so he kind of sort of fits

0:18:43.200,0:18:46.240
through there

0:18:44.720,0:18:47.840
does he fit through here yeah he kind of

0:18:46.240,0:18:48.640
sort of mostly fits does he fit through

0:18:47.840,0:18:51.520
here

0:18:48.640,0:18:53.039
yeah so make sure you can just drag your

0:18:51.520,0:18:54.640
hedgehog around

0:18:53.039,0:18:56.960
and make sure he fits through your whole

0:18:54.640,0:18:58.080
maze mine's just a little bit on the

0:18:56.960,0:18:59.760
tight side

0:18:58.080,0:19:02.000
so instead of 50 big i'm going to make

0:18:59.760,0:19:04.320
him 40 big

0:19:02.000,0:19:05.919
all right so pause the video get your

0:19:04.320,0:19:06.960
hedgehog together

0:19:05.919,0:19:09.600
and i'm going to come around i'm going

0:19:06.960,0:19:10.720
to see how my kiddos did with their maze

0:19:09.600,0:19:12.640
drawings

0:19:10.720,0:19:14.480
all right neely you're up first uh so

0:19:12.640,0:19:16.240
neila drew a maze

0:19:14.480,0:19:18.720
um let's see what kind of maze you drew

0:19:16.240,0:19:19.280
nila tell us about it nila where's your

0:19:18.720,0:19:22.240
where's your

0:19:19.280,0:19:23.520
victory point gonna be [ __ ] mostly

0:19:22.240,0:19:25.840
helped me with it

0:19:23.520,0:19:27.679
yeah and that's my factory and you're

0:19:25.840,0:19:30.400
gonna go up there great

0:19:27.679,0:19:31.840
all right bowen what's your theme oh no

0:19:30.400,0:19:32.240
hedgehogs in this one all right what do

0:19:31.840,0:19:34.720
you got

0:19:32.240,0:19:35.840
underwater they're trying to be friends

0:19:34.720,0:19:37.039
watch

0:19:35.840,0:19:38.320
so they're trying to be friends so

0:19:37.039,0:19:38.880
you're going to try to bring them around

0:19:38.320,0:19:41.760
and

0:19:38.880,0:19:41.760
make them be friends

0:19:42.880,0:19:47.280
yeah normally don't yeah don't octopus

0:19:44.960,0:19:48.480
normally eat jellyfish bowen

0:19:47.280,0:19:50.880
but this time they're trying to be

0:19:48.480,0:19:51.520
friends all right mckinley will do yours

0:19:50.880,0:19:53.200
next

0:19:51.520,0:19:55.039
oh we got a spiral thing going on here

0:19:53.200,0:19:58.080
so what what are your creatures

0:19:55.039,0:19:59.760
uh mine is an owl and a mouse

0:19:58.080,0:20:02.240
the mouth is actually bigger than the

0:19:59.760,0:20:02.240
album

0:20:03.360,0:20:07.840
and so i was gonna eat it uh and keegan

0:20:05.440,0:20:09.360
oh man yours is very elaborate what uh

0:20:07.840,0:20:11.840
what's your uh what's your plan here

0:20:09.360,0:20:13.679
keegan so you've got like a dog

0:20:11.840,0:20:15.760
um going through a very elaborate red

0:20:13.679,0:20:17.360
maze so keegan chose to do one that's

0:20:15.760,0:20:17.919
very elaborate it looks really cool

0:20:17.360,0:20:20.159
buddy

0:20:17.919,0:20:22.480
um but he's gonna finish it later uh

0:20:20.159,0:20:24.080
because it was kind of taking a while

0:20:22.480,0:20:25.600
um i love it are you excited about your

0:20:24.080,0:20:29.120
maze are you guys

0:20:25.600,0:20:30.000
excited about your mazes uh-huh all

0:20:29.120,0:20:33.039
right

0:20:30.000,0:20:34.000
so uh we've got our backgrounds ready to

0:20:33.039,0:20:37.360
go

0:20:34.000,0:20:41.280
and we're ready to add some more code

0:20:37.360,0:20:43.280
so first off go ahead and play your game

0:20:41.280,0:20:45.120
um and actually this is a fix i'm gonna

0:20:43.280,0:20:47.039
have to make my starting spot wasn't

0:20:45.120,0:20:48.960
quite right for my hedgehog

0:20:47.039,0:20:50.240
so i'm going to actually adjust my

0:20:48.960,0:20:51.919
starting spot so you can see how he

0:20:50.240,0:20:54.080
accidentally starts on the wall

0:20:51.919,0:20:55.360
whoops so i'm going to fix that so what

0:20:54.080,0:20:56.640
i'm going to do is i'm going to move him

0:20:55.360,0:20:58.159
over to here

0:20:56.640,0:20:59.679
so i want him to actually start right

0:20:58.159,0:21:01.280
here so that was a little change

0:20:59.679,0:21:03.840
now i've got two options i can either

0:21:01.280,0:21:04.320
change these numbers so like it says 186

0:21:03.840,0:21:07.120
there

0:21:04.320,0:21:08.320
so i could just change it or i could

0:21:07.120,0:21:09.760
bring in that command again

0:21:08.320,0:21:11.440
either way would work so i'm going to

0:21:09.760,0:21:15.440
change mine to match like what it says

0:21:11.440,0:21:17.039
there so it says 186 159

0:21:15.440,0:21:18.320
uh hopefully you planned to head better

0:21:17.039,0:21:19.679
than me and you don't need to move your

0:21:18.320,0:21:21.840
hedgehog

0:21:19.679,0:21:23.200
but for me i had to do a little movement

0:21:21.840,0:21:24.720
so now i can see that i'm going to try

0:21:23.200,0:21:26.640
to get around my maze

0:21:24.720,0:21:28.799
and everything's going to be good so the

0:21:26.640,0:21:31.280
thing that i want to fix next personally

0:21:28.799,0:21:32.799
is i don't like that i can just go right

0:21:31.280,0:21:33.520
through the walls right like this is

0:21:32.799,0:21:34.720
going to make my game

0:21:33.520,0:21:36.080
really easy if i can go just right

0:21:34.720,0:21:36.720
through the walls just zipping through

0:21:36.080,0:21:38.799
there

0:21:36.720,0:21:40.000
so let's write some code to stop that

0:21:38.799,0:21:42.159
from happening

0:21:40.000,0:21:43.360
so find the bottom of your code mine's

0:21:42.159,0:21:45.760
getting kind of long

0:21:43.360,0:21:48.000
and let's add another if statement if

0:21:45.760,0:21:51.440
statements are in control

0:21:48.000,0:21:51.440
and here's an if statement right here

0:21:52.080,0:21:55.440
now what we want to do with this if

0:21:53.600,0:21:58.640
statement is we want to see

0:21:55.440,0:22:01.120
if we're touching the wall right

0:21:58.640,0:22:03.200
so um touching is something that's in

0:22:01.120,0:22:04.559
sensing

0:22:03.200,0:22:06.880
and the way we know if we're touching

0:22:04.559,0:22:10.720
the wall or not is through this

0:22:06.880,0:22:14.559
touching color so grab a touching color

0:22:10.720,0:22:16.240
and drop it into your if statement

0:22:14.559,0:22:18.400
now how do we get this color this color

0:22:16.240,0:22:20.320
has to be exactly right so there's like

0:22:18.400,0:22:21.919
literally millions of different shades

0:22:20.320,0:22:23.520
of colors so i want the color to be

0:22:21.919,0:22:25.120
exactly right so you can click on this

0:22:23.520,0:22:27.679
and you could try to like select the

0:22:25.120,0:22:30.480
color but let me assure you

0:22:27.679,0:22:32.320
it would be hopeless completely hopeless

0:22:30.480,0:22:33.440
that's where this eyedropper comes in

0:22:32.320,0:22:36.320
so you're going to click on this

0:22:33.440,0:22:38.240
eyedropper and it immediately kind of

0:22:36.320,0:22:40.000
changes your screen a little bit

0:22:38.240,0:22:41.280
and the idea is it wants you to hover

0:22:40.000,0:22:42.400
your mouse somewhere over your

0:22:41.280,0:22:44.240
background that's why it's like an

0:22:42.400,0:22:45.440
eyedropper of the background

0:22:44.240,0:22:47.280
and what you want to do is you want to

0:22:45.440,0:22:49.200
pick one of your walls um

0:22:47.280,0:22:50.480
and it'll change to be that color and

0:22:49.200,0:22:53.440
then you just click

0:22:50.480,0:22:54.640
right and so what that did for you which

0:22:53.440,0:22:57.760
is super easy

0:22:54.640,0:22:59.280
is it picked exactly that shade um off

0:22:57.760,0:22:59.760
by a little bit in the shade won't work

0:22:59.280,0:23:01.039
at all

0:22:59.760,0:23:02.640
by the way that's a good reminder make

0:23:01.039,0:23:03.919
sure that your walls are exactly the

0:23:02.640,0:23:05.200
same color right you can't have

0:23:03.919,0:23:08.000
variations

0:23:05.200,0:23:09.440
because it'll only detect that shade so

0:23:08.000,0:23:12.159
if you're touching that color

0:23:09.440,0:23:13.760
what do we want to do um well if i could

0:23:12.159,0:23:15.919
stand up and still bring the camera so

0:23:13.760,0:23:17.039
imagine that i'm walking and i hit the

0:23:15.919,0:23:19.760
wall

0:23:17.039,0:23:21.760
then what i would do is i would do this

0:23:19.760,0:23:22.240
and if you think about describing words

0:23:21.760,0:23:24.240
uh

0:23:22.240,0:23:26.080
what happened there so i hit the wall

0:23:24.240,0:23:28.559
and then bone what did i do next can you

0:23:26.080,0:23:28.559
figure it out

0:23:28.960,0:23:32.159
yeah so i turned around and bounced off

0:23:30.400,0:23:35.360
that's exactly correct way to go bo

0:23:32.159,0:23:38.159
so those are both motions so

0:23:35.360,0:23:38.880
how do i turn around um so i can see

0:23:38.159,0:23:43.200
there's a turn

0:23:38.880,0:23:44.559
15 degrees and i put this in here

0:23:43.200,0:23:46.960
and it doesn't matter if you do turn

0:23:44.559,0:23:49.520
left or turn right so i hit the wall

0:23:46.960,0:23:50.799
and i turn around now this might be a

0:23:49.520,0:23:53.679
question for keegan

0:23:50.799,0:23:54.240
um keegan how many degrees is it if i

0:23:53.679,0:23:56.240
turn

0:23:54.240,0:23:58.159
completely the opposite direction do you

0:23:56.240,0:23:59.919
know how many degrees that is

0:23:58.159,0:24:02.400
180 you got it so you're going to do a

0:23:59.919,0:24:04.640
180 way to go bud

0:24:02.400,0:24:06.559
um and then we're gonna jump off the

0:24:04.640,0:24:08.240
wall some amount

0:24:06.559,0:24:11.679
now what i'd like to do is i'd like to

0:24:08.240,0:24:11.679
drop in another move 10

0:24:12.400,0:24:16.480
and when i hit the wall i'm going to

0:24:14.559,0:24:19.600
choose to bounce off

0:24:16.480,0:24:21.840
more than just one um speed amount

0:24:19.600,0:24:22.640
i'm going to bounce off double what my

0:24:21.840,0:24:24.320
speed is

0:24:22.640,0:24:26.320
does that make sense so so if we were to

0:24:24.320,0:24:29.039
hit and turn we want to jump off

0:24:26.320,0:24:31.039
twice what our speed is so how do you do

0:24:29.039,0:24:34.320
twice your speed

0:24:31.039,0:24:36.400
so you need an operator and so we want

0:24:34.320,0:24:37.679
to take speed and multiply it by two so

0:24:36.400,0:24:39.679
you've got to find the operator which is

0:24:37.679,0:24:43.600
for multiplication it looks like this

0:24:39.679,0:24:45.279
it's a little star and drop it in here

0:24:43.600,0:24:46.880
by the way you'll notice that it's

0:24:45.279,0:24:48.240
always outlines it in white when you can

0:24:46.880,0:24:49.600
drop it

0:24:48.240,0:24:51.520
but what i want to put in here is i want

0:24:49.600,0:24:56.720
to move two

0:24:51.520,0:24:56.720
times speed and speeds in my variables

0:24:58.320,0:25:02.159
so if i hit the wall i want to turn a

0:25:00.720,0:25:04.880
180

0:25:02.159,0:25:06.240
and then i want to move off two speed

0:25:04.880,0:25:08.640
amounts right and that's just

0:25:06.240,0:25:10.799
just so you bounce off quite a bit right

0:25:08.640,0:25:12.240
uh let's try it

0:25:10.799,0:25:14.000
so we're going to hit the uh the green

0:25:12.240,0:25:16.159
flag button and then now

0:25:14.000,0:25:18.000
when you hit a wall what should happen

0:25:16.159,0:25:20.559
is it should just kind of like

0:25:18.000,0:25:21.520
jump you off of it so you can like try

0:25:20.559,0:25:23.200
to go through it

0:25:21.520,0:25:24.559
but it shouldn't let you right so it

0:25:23.200,0:25:25.120
should stop you before you go through

0:25:24.559,0:25:27.679
the holes

0:25:25.120,0:25:29.919
so test a few of your walls and make

0:25:27.679,0:25:31.120
sure that you can bounce off of them

0:25:29.919,0:25:32.240
you also notice that i don't have

0:25:31.120,0:25:34.000
anything on the bottom here so i can

0:25:32.240,0:25:35.679
kind of like go down into the bottom

0:25:34.000,0:25:37.360
maybe i considered that a feature or

0:25:35.679,0:25:39.919
maybe i didn't think about it i can kind

0:25:37.360,0:25:41.760
of go off to the side some

0:25:39.919,0:25:43.039
but overall i'd say that mine's working

0:25:41.760,0:25:44.799
and i'm happy with it

0:25:43.039,0:25:46.720
if you made your maze too tight

0:25:44.799,0:25:47.840
somewhere this is probably where you're

0:25:46.720,0:25:49.440
going to figure it out

0:25:47.840,0:25:50.880
so if you've got a spot in your maze

0:25:49.440,0:25:52.720
that you can't go through oh i did

0:25:50.880,0:25:55.200
something crazy there

0:25:52.720,0:25:56.799
yikes i'm not going to worry about that

0:25:55.200,0:25:58.080
if you found a spot that you can't get

0:25:56.799,0:25:59.200
through or something that's just too

0:25:58.080,0:26:01.840
tight

0:25:59.200,0:26:03.600
you can go into your maze and fix it oh

0:26:01.840,0:26:07.440
i discovered a bug in my game if i if i

0:26:03.600,0:26:07.440
go at a diagonal i can go through walls

0:26:07.919,0:26:12.000
all right um that was an unexpected

0:26:09.840,0:26:13.600
feature so don't use diagonals

0:26:12.000,0:26:16.320
all right so i think mine's going pretty

0:26:13.600,0:26:18.240
good um what i want to do is i like

0:26:16.320,0:26:19.919
sounds right so like when i hit a wall i

0:26:18.240,0:26:22.400
like to have some kind of like small

0:26:19.919,0:26:23.039
sound now there's a lot of sounds that

0:26:22.400,0:26:24.880
are built in

0:26:23.039,0:26:26.720
and we could use one of those but i want

0:26:24.880,0:26:28.159
to use it as an opportunity to show you

0:26:26.720,0:26:30.080
something new

0:26:28.159,0:26:31.200
so down here in the lower left there's

0:26:30.080,0:26:35.279
like this ad

0:26:31.200,0:26:37.760
extensions thing click on add extensions

0:26:35.279,0:26:39.679
and there's actually a lot of additional

0:26:37.760,0:26:41.760
code extensions that you can add

0:26:39.679,0:26:43.919
some connect to robots and some do neat

0:26:41.760,0:26:45.760
things the one we want now is music so

0:26:43.919,0:26:47.520
go ahead and click on music

0:26:45.760,0:26:48.960
and when you add an extension what it'll

0:26:47.520,0:26:50.640
do is it'll basically just kind of like

0:26:48.960,0:26:53.279
add a new category

0:26:50.640,0:26:54.240
to the bottom of your toolbox so there's

0:26:53.279,0:26:57.360
a bunch of these

0:26:54.240,0:26:59.120
that you can add this one is is music

0:26:57.360,0:27:01.760
and so what i want to do is i want to

0:26:59.120,0:27:04.880
add a play drum

0:27:01.760,0:27:06.720
so whenever i hit the wall i want to

0:27:04.880,0:27:08.880
play a drum

0:27:06.720,0:27:10.880
you can pick between a snare drum or a

0:27:08.880,0:27:12.480
bass drum or all kinds of drums

0:27:10.880,0:27:14.480
i think i feel like a conglomerate drum

0:27:12.480,0:27:16.880
right now for no real reason

0:27:14.480,0:27:18.320
what should happen now is whenever i run

0:27:16.880,0:27:21.840
my game

0:27:18.320,0:27:21.840
when i hit the wall

0:27:22.320,0:27:25.520
it should play a little sound right so

0:27:23.919,0:27:27.120
add a little sound to your game

0:27:25.520,0:27:29.279
um and if you're not happy with one you

0:27:27.120,0:27:30.960
pick you can always try another one

0:27:29.279,0:27:32.640
uh the next thing i want to do is

0:27:30.960,0:27:34.640
actually save my game because i have not

0:27:32.640,0:27:37.279
saved it at all yet

0:27:34.640,0:27:38.320
so you can type in whatever you want i'm

0:27:37.279,0:27:40.799
going to call mine

0:27:38.320,0:27:43.760
hedgehog snack because he's going to eat

0:27:40.799,0:27:43.760
something here in a second

0:27:43.840,0:27:47.760
and then like i say it automatically

0:27:45.840,0:27:51.200
saves so you don't have to hit

0:27:47.760,0:27:53.600
anything for saved but you can hit file

0:27:51.200,0:27:55.440
save now if you'd like and then it gives

0:27:53.600,0:27:57.919
you that like warm fuzzy feeling

0:27:55.440,0:27:58.960
that you've got it saved all right the

0:27:57.919,0:28:01.440
next thing i want to do

0:27:58.960,0:28:02.000
is i want to have something that's my

0:28:01.440,0:28:04.159
goal my

0:28:02.000,0:28:06.000
target the thing i'm trying to get to

0:28:04.159,0:28:08.399
since i'm a hedgehog and i want a snack

0:28:06.000,0:28:10.159
i want something a hedgehog might eat

0:28:08.399,0:28:12.000
so i'm going to go into choose a sprite

0:28:10.159,0:28:14.399
here so go ahead and click on the circle

0:28:12.000,0:28:16.320
down here for choose a sprite

0:28:14.399,0:28:17.919
and i'm going to choose that a hedgehog

0:28:16.320,0:28:21.279
might like to eat beetles

0:28:17.919,0:28:22.799
um so i'm going to select the beetle um

0:28:21.279,0:28:25.360
obviously you can pick anything you'd

0:28:22.799,0:28:26.799
like but i'm going to pick up beetle

0:28:25.360,0:28:28.640
i'm going to make my beetle kind of

0:28:26.799,0:28:30.480
appropriately sized

0:28:28.640,0:28:33.039
and put him into the maze at the

0:28:30.480,0:28:34.880
location where i want him to go

0:28:33.039,0:28:36.320
now to be honest my beetle is a pretty

0:28:34.880,0:28:38.960
simple sprite

0:28:36.320,0:28:40.080
he doesn't move he doesn't have any code

0:28:38.960,0:28:42.080
at all

0:28:40.080,0:28:43.120
we're just going to detect if we hit him

0:28:42.080,0:28:44.880
or not

0:28:43.120,0:28:46.720
and if we hit him that's how we know we

0:28:44.880,0:28:50.080
won the game so he's just about the

0:28:46.720,0:28:51.919
easiest sprite you could possibly have

0:28:50.080,0:28:53.520
but you do see that there's no code here

0:28:51.919,0:28:56.559
go back to your hedgehog

0:28:53.520,0:28:58.320
and all your code will reappear so the

0:28:56.559,0:29:01.200
next thing i want to do is i want an

0:28:58.320,0:29:02.080
if statement to see if i'm touching my

0:29:01.200,0:29:03.840
beetle

0:29:02.080,0:29:06.480
um so we've done if statements a few

0:29:03.840,0:29:09.440
times go to control

0:29:06.480,0:29:11.120
i drag out an if statement by the way

0:29:09.440,0:29:12.720
one thing to be careful of bowen did

0:29:11.120,0:29:14.640
this for me as an example

0:29:12.720,0:29:16.399
is he accidentally put the if statement

0:29:14.640,0:29:17.840
like inside of another if statement

0:29:16.399,0:29:19.840
that's bad don't do that right

0:29:17.840,0:29:22.399
so make sure it's inside the forever

0:29:19.840,0:29:24.080
loop but all your if statements

0:29:22.399,0:29:25.120
like none of them should be like inside

0:29:24.080,0:29:26.080
of the other one so you can always kind

0:29:25.120,0:29:27.679
of like see

0:29:26.080,0:29:30.080
that they're all independent if

0:29:27.679,0:29:32.399
statements and that's important

0:29:30.080,0:29:34.480
and if your code's freaking out that may

0:29:32.399,0:29:38.240
be something that you have wrong

0:29:34.480,0:29:39.200
so this last one so if some condition

0:29:38.240,0:29:40.720
then do this

0:29:39.200,0:29:42.480
it's going to be a sensing condition

0:29:40.720,0:29:44.480
again

0:29:42.480,0:29:45.520
instead of a color we're going to say if

0:29:44.480,0:29:49.120
touching

0:29:45.520,0:29:50.960
mouse pointer but obviously we don't

0:29:49.120,0:29:53.919
want mouse pointer we want beetle

0:29:50.960,0:29:54.559
so if we're touching the beetle then we

0:29:53.919,0:29:56.720
want to

0:29:54.559,0:29:58.960
to win the game so we want to win the

0:29:56.720,0:30:00.640
game there

0:29:58.960,0:30:01.919
when i win the game what i want to do is

0:30:00.640,0:30:03.039
a couple things first i want to make

0:30:01.919,0:30:05.679
some sounds

0:30:03.039,0:30:06.240
let's see what sounds my hedgehog has

0:30:05.679,0:30:09.360
he's got

0:30:06.240,0:30:11.360
pop i don't want pop pop doesn't sound

0:30:09.360,0:30:14.000
like i'm eating a beetle

0:30:11.360,0:30:15.919
so i want to add a sound so just to

0:30:14.000,0:30:18.399
recap i went into hedgehog

0:30:15.919,0:30:19.279
i went into sounds and then down here

0:30:18.399,0:30:22.159
i'm going to click on

0:30:19.279,0:30:23.600
choose a sound and i think the sound

0:30:22.159,0:30:26.799
that i would recommend for you is

0:30:23.600,0:30:28.399
chomp the easiest way i think to find it

0:30:26.799,0:30:31.360
is to start typing it

0:30:28.399,0:30:33.360
and then to add chomp and so if you play

0:30:31.360,0:30:35.120
chomp

0:30:33.360,0:30:37.120
um we actually use that with apple if

0:30:35.120,0:30:40.559
you remember

0:30:37.120,0:30:41.440
now chomp sounds okay but i would rather

0:30:40.559,0:30:43.760
repeat

0:30:41.440,0:30:45.520
chomp four times and i'm going to do

0:30:43.760,0:30:48.799
that in my code right

0:30:45.520,0:30:50.320
so as soon as i hit the beetle i want to

0:30:48.799,0:30:53.520
chomp four times

0:30:50.320,0:30:53.520
so i'm going to go to control

0:30:53.760,0:30:57.279
and i'm going to add a repeat loop

0:30:58.000,0:31:01.360
to go four times

0:31:01.600,0:31:04.799
and what i want to do four times is i

0:31:03.039,0:31:09.440
want to chomp until

0:31:04.799,0:31:11.120
done so play sound chomp until done

0:31:09.440,0:31:12.559
so i'm going to try this out and then it

0:31:11.120,0:31:13.279
sounds like i need to help my campers

0:31:12.559,0:31:16.640
out some

0:31:13.279,0:31:18.559
so i'm going to go ahead and move around

0:31:16.640,0:31:20.240
i'm trying not to use diagonals because

0:31:18.559,0:31:21.440
i discovered diagonals are bad which i

0:31:20.240,0:31:23.039
learned just now

0:31:21.440,0:31:26.159
um and then as soon as i get to my

0:31:23.039,0:31:26.159
beetle what should happen

0:31:28.159,0:31:32.559
um it goes forever right so it kind of

0:31:30.960,0:31:34.799
sort of almost worked

0:31:32.559,0:31:36.720
um the thing that didn't work is it just

0:31:34.799,0:31:38.320
kept doing it forever and ever and ever

0:31:36.720,0:31:40.000
so i'm going to fix this one thing and

0:31:38.320,0:31:42.799
then i'll help my campers

0:31:40.000,0:31:44.640
so the last thing i want to do to fix it

0:31:42.799,0:31:47.279
is i want the game to end

0:31:44.640,0:31:50.240
after i start chopping them to end the

0:31:47.279,0:31:53.760
game go to control

0:31:50.240,0:31:55.919
go to stop all and then put it on the

0:31:53.760,0:31:57.519
bottom of your repeat floor

0:31:55.919,0:32:00.000
and then things should things should

0:31:57.519,0:32:01.279
work better so as you play your game i'm

0:32:00.000,0:32:02.320
going to cheat here and go diagonally

0:32:01.279,0:32:03.679
through my wall

0:32:02.320,0:32:06.080
which i discovered i could do only

0:32:03.679,0:32:06.080
recently

0:32:06.240,0:32:09.679
and so it chomps one two three four

0:32:07.760,0:32:11.120
times and then the game ends

0:32:09.679,0:32:13.120
see if you can get that working in your

0:32:11.120,0:32:14.240
code and i'll help my campers do the

0:32:13.120,0:32:15.600
same

0:32:14.240,0:32:17.840
all right so i think mine's going pretty

0:32:15.600,0:32:19.039
good uh one bug uh that mckinley had

0:32:17.840,0:32:22.960
which was kind of interesting

0:32:19.039,0:32:24.399
um her uh target um just so happened to

0:32:22.960,0:32:27.120
have the same color

0:32:24.399,0:32:29.039
as her walls so when she like almost hit

0:32:27.120,0:32:30.960
her target it bounced him off

0:32:29.039,0:32:32.399
if that does happen to you just draw a

0:32:30.960,0:32:34.240
different color kind of on the outside

0:32:32.399,0:32:35.840
of it and it'll it'll fix that bug so

0:32:34.240,0:32:36.480
you might have that it's kind of a weird

0:32:35.840,0:32:38.559
bug

0:32:36.480,0:32:40.000
that'll affect some people uh let's go

0:32:38.559,0:32:41.679
ahead and add one more feature

0:32:40.000,0:32:44.559
the feature that i want to add is a

0:32:41.679,0:32:45.279
timer um a timer is a very special type

0:32:44.559,0:32:47.519
of variable

0:32:45.279,0:32:50.080
because it's built in um and so if you

0:32:47.519,0:32:52.640
go to motion

0:32:50.080,0:32:54.080
there's a built-in timer uh in here

0:32:52.640,0:32:55.679
which is kind of interesting

0:32:54.080,0:32:57.760
um so i've got to scroll around oh it's

0:32:55.679,0:33:01.039
not it's not a motion it's in sensing

0:32:57.760,0:33:02.000
um there's a built-in timer um and so

0:33:01.039,0:33:05.200
this timer

0:33:02.000,0:33:06.960
starts when your game starts um and

0:33:05.200,0:33:08.640
i like to go ahead and like do that

0:33:06.960,0:33:11.279
explicitly so when my game starts

0:33:08.640,0:33:12.480
i want to reset the timer so what i'm

0:33:11.279,0:33:13.840
going to do is i'm going to take reset

0:33:12.480,0:33:15.440
timer and put it in here

0:33:13.840,0:33:17.840
to make sure that it zeros out when the

0:33:15.440,0:33:20.399
game starts

0:33:17.840,0:33:22.320
and then what i want to do is i want to

0:33:20.399,0:33:25.279
say what my time was

0:33:22.320,0:33:26.880
at the end so scroll down to the end

0:33:25.279,0:33:28.559
here

0:33:26.880,0:33:31.039
and so i'm going to go chomp chomp chomp

0:33:28.559,0:33:32.320
but before i say stop all i want to say

0:33:31.039,0:33:36.159
something i want to say

0:33:32.320,0:33:40.799
either time so go into looks

0:33:36.159,0:33:40.799
i put on a say hello for two seconds

0:33:41.600,0:33:45.600
um and then what i want to do is i want

0:33:43.360,0:33:48.080
to say like your time was

0:33:45.600,0:33:49.360
uh and then the timer um since i want to

0:33:48.080,0:33:50.960
do kind of like two things i want to say

0:33:49.360,0:33:53.919
like your time was and then also

0:33:50.960,0:33:54.799
i do the timer i've gotta put those

0:33:53.919,0:33:58.399
together

0:33:54.799,0:33:59.760
uh with a join command once you see it

0:33:58.399,0:34:01.120
it'll make sense so instead of just

0:33:59.760,0:34:06.159
saying a single thing i'm gonna say

0:34:01.120,0:34:10.000
join i'm gonna say your time

0:34:06.159,0:34:11.280
was and then

0:34:10.000,0:34:14.560
what i'm going to say is i'm going to

0:34:11.280,0:34:16.639
grab that timer from out of sensing

0:34:14.560,0:34:19.520
so your time was and then it's just

0:34:16.639,0:34:21.359
going to say a number

0:34:19.520,0:34:24.159
and you can phrase it however you want

0:34:21.359,0:34:27.520
you can say your time was

0:34:24.159,0:34:29.520
or you could just say time or you could

0:34:27.520,0:34:31.599
you can make it whatever you want you

0:34:29.520,0:34:32.960
could also put multiple of these joins

0:34:31.599,0:34:34.720
together and put it in the middle of

0:34:32.960,0:34:36.560
your sentence

0:34:34.720,0:34:38.079
knock yourself out right i'm going to

0:34:36.560,0:34:40.720
keep it simple and i'm just going to say

0:34:38.079,0:34:43.040
say and i'm going to join the word time

0:34:40.720,0:34:47.919
and timer for two seconds

0:34:43.040,0:34:49.839
so now whenever i run it my game starts

0:34:47.919,0:34:52.079
um and so i can run around i can do my

0:34:49.839,0:34:52.079
game

0:34:54.320,0:35:03.200
uh and when i finish uh it says my

0:34:58.240,0:35:05.359
time was 12 uh something

0:35:03.200,0:35:06.960
now some little tweaks so the things i

0:35:05.359,0:35:08.560
didn't like these are little tweaks

0:35:06.960,0:35:11.040
i would like for it to save my time for

0:35:08.560,0:35:12.800
a little longer maybe five seconds

0:35:11.040,0:35:15.520
just so i can read it so i can register

0:35:12.800,0:35:16.800
whether it's better than previous or not

0:35:15.520,0:35:19.119
another thing i don't like is i don't

0:35:16.800,0:35:20.640
like that when i click the green flag

0:35:19.119,0:35:22.000
my timer starts me right away because

0:35:20.640,0:35:23.440
i've got to click the green flag and i

0:35:22.000,0:35:24.400
got to move my hand over to the arrow

0:35:23.440,0:35:26.640
keys

0:35:24.400,0:35:27.599
so just just to fix that this is a

0:35:26.640,0:35:30.400
little fix

0:35:27.599,0:35:32.320
i'm going to say something just to kind

0:35:30.400,0:35:34.720
of like pause the game a little bit

0:35:32.320,0:35:37.359
so i'm going to go into looks i'm going

0:35:34.720,0:35:39.200
to drag say hello for 2 seconds

0:35:37.359,0:35:41.200
and i'm going to put it just before i

0:35:39.200,0:35:43.520
reset the timer

0:35:41.200,0:35:45.119
and it's just going to say ready or

0:35:43.520,0:35:46.960
maybe get ready

0:35:45.119,0:35:48.960
whatever you want so now if i hit the

0:35:46.960,0:35:50.960
green flag it says get ready and it

0:35:48.960,0:35:53.839
gives me a second to move my hands over

0:35:50.960,0:35:54.800
and now i can start uh trying to get to

0:35:53.839,0:35:56.560
my goal

0:35:54.800,0:35:58.640
i hit the wall a couple times so this is

0:35:56.560,0:36:02.119
not going to be my best ever

0:35:58.640,0:36:05.520
and then i get to it chomp chomp chomp

0:36:02.119,0:36:06.480
11.25 so you can play your game as many

0:36:05.520,0:36:07.760
times as you want

0:36:06.480,0:36:10.320
[Music]

0:36:07.760,0:36:11.920
and you can try to see if you can get an

0:36:10.320,0:36:14.640
optimum time

0:36:11.920,0:36:15.599
and then of course you want to have your

0:36:14.640,0:36:18.000
parent play it

0:36:15.599,0:36:19.119
uh and see what they can do so mine that

0:36:18.000,0:36:22.800
time

0:36:19.119,0:36:25.520
was oh 10.4 a little bit better

0:36:22.800,0:36:27.040
all right so a little feature there uh

0:36:25.520,0:36:28.800
with like getting you ready it's kind of

0:36:27.040,0:36:31.359
like a get ready set go

0:36:28.800,0:36:31.920
um and then a little feature down here

0:36:31.359,0:36:34.400
uh

0:36:31.920,0:36:34.960
for the for the timer all right so i'm

0:36:34.400,0:36:36.560
gonna

0:36:34.960,0:36:38.800
uh go around and i'm gonna see how my

0:36:36.560,0:36:40.560
campers did i'm also gonna click this

0:36:38.800,0:36:42.480
share button

0:36:40.560,0:36:44.000
and the share button gives me a url that

0:36:42.480,0:36:45.520
i could share with other people

0:36:44.000,0:36:47.040
in order to be able to share remember

0:36:45.520,0:36:48.640
you have to have a logged in as an

0:36:47.040,0:36:49.839
account and you have to verify your

0:36:48.640,0:36:51.119
email address

0:36:49.839,0:36:53.359
all right campers you're ready for me to

0:36:51.119,0:36:55.359
see what you made all right neela you're

0:36:53.359,0:36:58.079
up first let's see what you've got

0:36:55.359,0:36:59.520
so it says get ready um and then you're

0:36:58.079,0:37:00.480
going to take your hedgehog around your

0:36:59.520,0:37:02.480
maze

0:37:00.480,0:37:04.720
um your your game is very difficult

0:37:02.480,0:37:08.079
because of all those diagonals isn't it

0:37:04.720,0:37:10.320
so you kind of work your way down

0:37:08.079,0:37:12.160
you're doing great babe neil made it

0:37:10.320,0:37:13.599
past the hard spot

0:37:12.160,0:37:15.040
i had to edit a little bit there because

0:37:13.599,0:37:16.400
it took just a little bit yours is

0:37:15.040,0:37:18.000
challenging neil get the bread and we'll

0:37:16.400,0:37:21.680
see what your time was

0:37:18.000,0:37:24.320
your time was oh yeah 38 seconds

0:37:21.680,0:37:27.680
great job neela give us the vist there

0:37:24.320,0:37:30.880
all right bone let's see it hit go

0:37:27.680,0:37:33.040
i'll save your green flag bowen

0:37:30.880,0:37:35.280
all right so bowen says get ready uh and

0:37:33.040,0:37:36.880
he's got this octopus theme

0:37:35.280,0:37:38.480
uh so he's going around he's trying to

0:37:36.880,0:37:40.320
get the jellyfish

0:37:38.480,0:37:42.000
now the jellyfish to be clear is not

0:37:40.320,0:37:45.760
going to get eaten by the octopus the

0:37:42.000,0:37:45.760
jellyfish and the octopus are friends

0:37:48.960,0:37:54.560
cool looks great you got a time of 15.2

0:37:53.200,0:37:56.960
great job bone did you have fun making

0:37:54.560,0:38:00.240
this game great job

0:37:56.960,0:38:03.200
we'll go with [ __ ] next so sissy's got

0:38:00.240,0:38:04.400
uh the owl theme and as mentioned she

0:38:03.200,0:38:07.359
has a black

0:38:04.400,0:38:08.960
uh wall and her mouse had black on it so

0:38:07.359,0:38:09.920
she had to like outline it in red or

0:38:08.960,0:38:11.119
something

0:38:09.920,0:38:12.160
all right so she's playing her game

0:38:11.119,0:38:13.440
where are you at session i don't even

0:38:12.160,0:38:16.640
see oh

0:38:13.440,0:38:17.680
her her owl is teeny tiny um she is

0:38:16.640,0:38:20.480
playing

0:38:17.680,0:38:21.119
it's just the world's smallest owl and

0:38:20.480,0:38:23.680
this al

0:38:21.119,0:38:25.520
books it around the course so it's a

0:38:23.680,0:38:28.560
super spiral

0:38:25.520,0:38:31.040
it's minnie albers mega mouse

0:38:28.560,0:38:33.040
and so you got it in 23 seconds great

0:38:31.040,0:38:34.400
job sis great creativity

0:38:33.040,0:38:36.960
all right keegan let's see yours hit the

0:38:34.400,0:38:36.960
green flag

0:38:37.440,0:38:44.960
um get ready so he's got a super dog

0:38:41.359,0:38:44.960
that is not the right path super dog

0:38:45.040,0:38:48.880
so he's got a super dog running around

his red maze

0:38:48.880,0:38:53.520
is this dog man is that who this is no

0:38:51.280,0:38:53.520
way

0:38:55.119,0:39:06.160
go the right way

0:39:01.040,0:39:07.920
i want a bark sound effect 24057

0:39:06.160,0:39:09.520
all right great job everybody everybody

0:39:07.920,0:39:11.920
have fun yes

0:39:09.520,0:39:14.240
yes yeah cool uh so i'll go and say a

0:39:11.920,0:39:16.240
couple things uh just to wrap it up uh

0:39:14.240,0:39:18.079
so the the learning things from today

0:39:16.240,0:39:19.599
coding is fun uh you can do this that's

0:39:18.079,0:39:22.240
kind of our message every day

0:39:19.599,0:39:22.960
um art and science like this drawing

0:39:22.240,0:39:24.720
things

0:39:22.960,0:39:26.720
really are important to make your games

0:39:24.720,0:39:28.560
custom and make uh you own it

0:39:26.720,0:39:29.760
and your creativity uh you can see just

0:39:28.560,0:39:30.320
from my campers here is really what

0:39:29.760,0:39:32.640
makes this

0:39:30.320,0:39:34.240
uh things interesting a few more things

0:39:32.640,0:39:36.320
in here but i won't worry about those

0:39:34.240,0:39:38.240
i look forward to seeing you tomorrow i

0:39:36.320,0:39:42.910
will start another coding adventure

0:39:38.240,0:39:44.720
see you then bye

0:39:42.910,0:39:46.079
[Music]

0:39:44.720,0:39:48.480
i didn't know you could do that

0:39:46.079,0:39:50.160
apparently if you do it

0:39:48.480,0:39:52.800
if you go at a diagonal you just go

0:39:50.160,0:39:55.760
right to the wall

0:39:52.800,0:39:58.400
neither bob nor i tried diagonals i

0:39:55.760,0:40:02.000
didn't even think about diagonals until

0:39:58.400,0:40:02.560
needles mate by the way i had to make

0:40:02.000,0:40:04.240
this

0:40:02.560,0:40:05.520
if it bothered you that if you hold down

0:40:04.240,0:40:06.160
two keys at the same time that you

0:40:05.520,0:40:08.240
actually can

0:40:06.160,0:40:10.000
sometimes walk through walls oh this is

0:40:08.240,0:40:12.319
where now i can't even do it

0:40:10.000,0:40:14.319
but oh there we go i got through if it

0:40:12.319,0:40:16.160
bothers you about the diagonals um

0:40:14.319,0:40:18.319
one one way you can fix it this is not

0:40:16.160,0:40:20.000
required at all

0:40:18.319,0:40:22.160
is really there's this code right here

0:40:20.000,0:40:23.599
so there's this if statement right here

0:40:22.160,0:40:25.440
that's asking if you're touching the

0:40:23.599,0:40:27.040
color um well here's what i'm going to

0:40:25.440,0:40:28.160
do to fix it this is completely optional

0:40:27.040,0:40:30.720
you just watch me

0:40:28.160,0:40:32.079
is i really want to take this code and

0:40:30.720,0:40:34.720
separate it by itself

0:40:32.079,0:40:35.920
and i want to call this code after every

0:40:34.720,0:40:37.440
move

0:40:35.920,0:40:39.359
and a good way to do this this is a

0:40:37.440,0:40:41.359
great way to introduce like functions

0:40:39.359,0:40:42.560
um functions in scratch are called

0:40:41.359,0:40:43.760
blocks

0:40:42.560,0:40:46.640
you can just watch this you don't have

0:40:43.760,0:40:49.599
to do it but if i make a function called

0:40:46.640,0:40:50.880
check for the wall which is not really a

0:40:49.599,0:40:52.240
great name for a function but that's my

0:40:50.880,0:40:54.560
name for the function

0:40:52.240,0:40:56.400
so this code right here is the function

0:40:54.560,0:40:59.680
check for the wall

0:40:56.400,0:41:02.960
and now i can put that in everywhere

0:40:59.680,0:41:04.800
after move speed and now what will

0:41:02.960,0:41:06.560
happen is i've made that function that i

0:41:04.800,0:41:08.560
can reuse you can see i used it four

0:41:06.560,0:41:10.480
times

0:41:08.560,0:41:11.920
and now it shouldn't let me go through

0:41:10.480,0:41:13.280
the wall so even if i'm like down here

0:41:11.920,0:41:14.319
and i hold down both keys to go to

0:41:13.280,0:41:16.640
diagonal

0:41:14.319,0:41:18.400
i just can't get through there right so

0:41:16.640,0:41:20.319
you do not have to add that

0:41:18.400,0:41:22.240
is not a requirement maybe the next time

0:41:20.319,0:41:23.839
i film this i'll put it in there

0:41:22.240,0:41:26.160
but it is a great time to show you

0:41:23.839,0:41:27.200
functions um and functions or whenever

0:41:26.160,0:41:28.880
you're gonna have the same code in

0:41:27.200,0:41:31.119
multiple places here i've got it in

0:41:28.880,0:41:32.160
four different places and you can see

0:41:31.119,0:41:34.240
how i broke that out

0:41:32.160,0:41:35.520
and it fixed this bug uh going through

0:41:34.240,0:41:37.599
the wall all right

0:41:35.520,0:41:38.960
that little edition it just bugged my

0:41:37.599,0:41:39.760
family so i thought i'd show you how to

0:41:38.960,0:41:41.280
fix it if it

0:41:39.760,0:41:48.720
happened to bother you all right thanks

0:41:41.280,0:41:48.720
for joining us bye
