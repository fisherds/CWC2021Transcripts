0:00:04.640,0:00:07.600
hey hey

0:00:05.279,0:00:09.519
welcome to connecting with code uh we're

0:00:07.600,0:00:10.800
super excited to have us uh have you

0:00:09.519,0:00:13.840
join us this summer

0:00:10.800,0:00:14.400
i'm here with my campers the way this

0:00:13.840,0:00:17.039
works

0:00:14.400,0:00:18.160
is we film these videos uh you watch

0:00:17.039,0:00:19.920
them at home

0:00:18.160,0:00:21.840
if you're a certain age where you need

0:00:19.920,0:00:23.199
help from adult you should watch it with

0:00:21.840,0:00:24.160
your adults

0:00:23.199,0:00:26.240
but if you're a certain age where you

0:00:24.160,0:00:26.880
can do it by yourself that age is up to

0:00:26.240,0:00:28.960
you

0:00:26.880,0:00:30.000
then you'll do it by yourself to give

0:00:28.960,0:00:33.120
you an idea of

0:00:30.000,0:00:33.840
ages i'm gonna switch my camera here and

0:00:33.120,0:00:35.840
i'm gonna show

0:00:33.840,0:00:37.680
uh the campers that are here with me uh

0:00:35.840,0:00:39.200
we'll start with uh with our first

0:00:37.680,0:00:44.000
camper what's your name camper

0:00:39.200,0:00:46.879
leila neila how old is neela

0:00:44.000,0:00:48.399
go into preschool yeah so neela's five

0:00:46.879,0:00:50.079
and so who's helping needless and she's

0:00:48.399,0:00:53.039
five

0:00:50.079,0:00:54.239
mommy yeah mommy's helping uh kneeling

0:00:53.039,0:00:55.440
who's our next camper and how old are

0:00:54.239,0:00:58.079
you

0:00:55.440,0:01:00.320
and how old are you bowen and so bowen's

0:00:58.079,0:01:00.960
seven and so mommy is helping neela a

0:01:00.320,0:01:02.719
lot

0:01:00.960,0:01:04.080
um and she's helping bowen just a little

0:01:02.719,0:01:05.600
less so

0:01:04.080,0:01:07.600
at seven and five they can do it with

0:01:05.600,0:01:09.439
mommy's help then i've got my campers

0:01:07.600,0:01:10.720
who do it all by themselves so first

0:01:09.439,0:01:11.280
camper doing it by yourself what's your

0:01:10.720,0:01:14.159
name

0:01:11.280,0:01:16.000
um i am keegan fisher and how old are

0:01:14.159,0:01:17.040
you i am nine years old and i am

0:01:16.000,0:01:18.960
instilled good

0:01:17.040,0:01:20.320
so he's nine but he's been coding for a

0:01:18.960,0:01:22.720
while so he's going to be doing it by

0:01:20.320,0:01:25.759
himself and our final camper

0:01:22.720,0:01:26.159
i'm mckinley and i am 10 years old and

0:01:25.759,0:01:28.159
she

0:01:26.159,0:01:29.280
is an experienced coder and she's

0:01:28.159,0:01:31.680
definitely doing it

0:01:29.280,0:01:33.600
by herself uh so that's the campers that

0:01:31.680,0:01:35.600
i have with me here today

0:01:33.600,0:01:37.200
uh before we get started uh on our first

0:01:35.600,0:01:38.400
piece of material uh well i want to do a

0:01:37.200,0:01:40.240
quick acknowledgement

0:01:38.400,0:01:41.600
uh the material here was made by me and

0:01:40.240,0:01:43.600
also bob shafer

0:01:41.600,0:01:44.720
who works at missing college i'm filming

0:01:43.600,0:01:46.399
it uh but he also

0:01:44.720,0:01:47.759
was a big part of making these things

0:01:46.399,0:01:49.520
possible

0:01:47.759,0:01:51.600
so what are we gonna do today uh so

0:01:49.520,0:01:54.720
today what we're doing is we're building

0:01:51.600,0:01:56.000
a scratch app this whole week is coding

0:01:54.720,0:01:59.520
in scratch

0:01:56.000,0:02:00.960
scratch is a website that you'll go to

0:01:59.520,0:02:02.479
to where you build things and learn how

0:02:00.960,0:02:03.840
to code hopefully a lot of people have

0:02:02.479,0:02:05.840
heard about scratch

0:02:03.840,0:02:07.759
let's show a demo of what we're trying

0:02:05.840,0:02:09.679
to make today so today we're making one

0:02:07.759,0:02:11.360
called alphabet breakfast

0:02:09.679,0:02:12.800
so this is the solution uh so you're

0:02:11.360,0:02:14.080
just kind of watching for a minute and

0:02:12.800,0:02:15.760
the solution

0:02:14.080,0:02:17.280
and the idea of this app let me go and

0:02:15.760,0:02:20.160
make a full screen here

0:02:17.280,0:02:22.160
is that you are avery so avery is

0:02:20.160,0:02:22.879
walking around collecting things and she

0:02:22.160,0:02:25.680
has to collect

0:02:22.879,0:02:27.360
food in alphabetical order so the first

0:02:25.680,0:02:28.879
thing she collected there was an apple

0:02:27.360,0:02:31.200
um anybody know what she needs to

0:02:28.879,0:02:34.720
collect next what starts with b

0:02:31.200,0:02:36.239
banana yeah i nearly got so a banana

0:02:34.720,0:02:37.760
and if i try to eat the wrong thing

0:02:36.239,0:02:38.160
let's say i tried to eat an egg next

0:02:37.760,0:02:41.519
does

0:02:38.160,0:02:42.879
eat eggs start with c not really so it

0:02:41.519,0:02:44.720
just says keep trying food should be

0:02:42.879,0:02:45.599
eaten alphabetically so i got to find a

0:02:44.720,0:02:49.040
seafood anybody

0:02:45.599,0:02:50.959
see a good seafood cake cake

0:02:49.040,0:02:53.360
and so we eat cake what comes after cake

0:02:50.959,0:02:53.360
you think

0:02:54.160,0:03:00.159
donut uh after donut

0:02:57.599,0:03:00.159
egg

0:03:00.720,0:03:06.319
and then she does a little dance

0:03:03.760,0:03:08.800
that's what we're building today it's a

0:03:06.319,0:03:09.920
long song i guess

0:03:08.800,0:03:11.440
that's what we're building today and

0:03:09.920,0:03:12.319
that's our goal and we're going to be

0:03:11.440,0:03:14.560
building it up

0:03:12.319,0:03:16.400
uh with a block based programming

0:03:14.560,0:03:18.400
language called scratch

0:03:16.400,0:03:19.840
um and we're going to be learning a lot

0:03:18.400,0:03:21.360
of great things today these are kind of

0:03:19.840,0:03:21.920
like our learning objectives maybe i'll

0:03:21.360,0:03:23.920
come

0:03:21.920,0:03:25.440
reflect on these at the end uh but what

0:03:23.920,0:03:27.920
you need to do is you need to go to this

0:03:25.440,0:03:27.920
website

0:03:28.680,0:03:32.319
scratch.mit.edu

0:03:29.920,0:03:33.680
you can see scratch was first made uh

0:03:32.319,0:03:36.480
when it was at mit

0:03:33.680,0:03:38.080
um and it's grown so much since then

0:03:36.480,0:03:39.840
when you're on this scratch page your

0:03:38.080,0:03:41.920
first choice is you can either

0:03:39.840,0:03:43.760
just get started which is great you'll

0:03:41.920,0:03:46.159
just click on create if you want

0:03:43.760,0:03:47.920
or if you like you can sign in it

0:03:46.159,0:03:48.400
doesn't matter to me if you sign in or

0:03:47.920,0:03:50.159
not

0:03:48.400,0:03:51.680
i'm in general i think that you should

0:03:50.159,0:03:53.200
because your work will will be saved

0:03:51.680,0:03:55.439
more permanently to your account

0:03:53.200,0:03:56.560
um but it's pretty easy to sign up and

0:03:55.439,0:03:58.640
if you want to do that

0:03:56.560,0:03:59.760
you can just pause the video and go do

0:03:58.640,0:04:01.920
that on your own

0:03:59.760,0:04:03.760
so campers are you ready to get started

0:04:01.920,0:04:05.280
yes yes all right everybody click on

0:04:03.760,0:04:07.680
create

0:04:05.280,0:04:08.480
when you click on create it makes a new

0:04:07.680,0:04:10.879
program

0:04:08.480,0:04:13.680
um whenever you have a new program uh

0:04:10.879,0:04:15.840
you get to see the editor here

0:04:13.680,0:04:17.120
the editor is broken into a lot of

0:04:15.840,0:04:18.560
different places

0:04:17.120,0:04:20.560
let's just talk about it some so we're

0:04:18.560,0:04:22.240
more familiar with scratch

0:04:20.560,0:04:24.479
this area right over here this upper

0:04:22.240,0:04:27.440
right is called the stage

0:04:24.479,0:04:28.800
below the stage are the different actors

0:04:27.440,0:04:31.600
that are like on the stage

0:04:28.800,0:04:33.280
um sprites ah shoot i gave it away

0:04:31.600,0:04:35.440
scratch calls them the special name does

0:04:33.280,0:04:37.680
anybody know what the special name is

0:04:35.440,0:04:39.919
sprite i gave away the answer so they're

0:04:37.680,0:04:41.040
called sprites we have one sprite right

0:04:39.919,0:04:44.160
now

0:04:41.040,0:04:47.360
but we can actually have many sprites

0:04:44.160,0:04:48.720
sprites have code so each sprite has

0:04:47.360,0:04:50.960
their own code

0:04:48.720,0:04:52.720
the code is over here in the left in the

0:04:50.960,0:04:57.680
toolbar let's drag over

0:04:52.720,0:05:00.960
one line of code so drag over move 10.

0:04:57.680,0:05:01.680
so now you can see that our cat has code

0:05:00.960,0:05:04.400
that he can run

0:05:01.680,0:05:05.520
move10 so the question is how do we run

0:05:04.400,0:05:07.120
this code

0:05:05.520,0:05:08.560
well one way to run it is to double

0:05:07.120,0:05:09.840
click on it so double click on where it

0:05:08.560,0:05:11.280
says move 10

0:05:09.840,0:05:14.000
and you'll notice something about your

0:05:11.280,0:05:17.440
mouse every time you double click it

0:05:14.000,0:05:19.039
he'll go over to the right now one fun

0:05:17.440,0:05:20.240
thing is you can also just kind of drag

0:05:19.039,0:05:22.320
him back over here

0:05:20.240,0:05:23.520
and you can double click it and you can

0:05:22.320,0:05:25.120
run it some more

0:05:23.520,0:05:27.360
eventually you'll get bored with doing

0:05:25.120,0:05:30.479
this so once you're bored with this

0:05:27.360,0:05:32.800
let's let's do some more things now

0:05:30.479,0:05:33.520
double clicking on it is one way to run

0:05:32.800,0:05:36.160
code

0:05:33.520,0:05:36.720
but a much better way to run code is to

0:05:36.160,0:05:40.240
add

0:05:36.720,0:05:42.240
a win green flag clicked so let's

0:05:40.240,0:05:44.639
look at these uh commands if you scroll

0:05:42.240,0:05:47.520
down through here there's some blue ones

0:05:44.639,0:05:49.360
uh and then there's some purple ones and

0:05:47.520,0:05:50.720
then there's some yellow ones and maybe

0:05:49.360,0:05:53.120
you call that orange

0:05:50.720,0:05:54.400
and there's a lot of commands to make it

0:05:53.120,0:05:56.479
easier to get around the commands

0:05:54.400,0:05:59.280
they're broken into categories

0:05:56.479,0:06:00.080
the category we want is events so click

0:05:59.280,0:06:01.680
on

0:06:00.080,0:06:04.319
over here on the far left where it says

0:06:01.680,0:06:05.520
events and it'll scroll you to that

0:06:04.319,0:06:07.280
section of the code

0:06:05.520,0:06:09.440
so you can kind of see that these things

0:06:07.280,0:06:11.759
they just help you scroll around

0:06:09.440,0:06:12.880
to find the right category so the most

0:06:11.759,0:06:16.319
common way to run

0:06:12.880,0:06:20.000
code is to grab this when green

0:06:16.319,0:06:22.800
flag clicked and put it and just snap it

0:06:20.000,0:06:24.960
right on top of your code

0:06:22.800,0:06:26.880
so this is what most scratch programs

0:06:24.960,0:06:28.240
look like so this is considered like the

0:06:26.880,0:06:30.800
start of the program

0:06:28.240,0:06:31.360
so our cat when the green flag is

0:06:30.800,0:06:33.280
clicked

0:06:31.360,0:06:35.440
he's going to move 10. let's try it a

0:06:33.280,0:06:38.639
couple times so click on

0:06:35.440,0:06:41.520
the green flag and he'll move he'll move

0:06:38.639,0:06:41.520
across the stage

0:06:42.240,0:06:45.440
so this is just to kind of get you

0:06:43.600,0:06:48.080
familiar with the environment

0:06:45.440,0:06:49.039
that we're working in but actually we we

0:06:48.080,0:06:50.479
don't need a cat

0:06:49.039,0:06:52.160
at all in this game if you remember

0:06:50.479,0:06:53.280
looking at the solution there are no

0:06:52.160,0:06:55.680
cats in there

0:06:53.280,0:06:57.280
so we don't need this particular sprite

0:06:55.680,0:06:59.680
so what i want to do is i want to delete

0:06:57.280,0:07:01.680
this sprite so he was just a test

0:06:59.680,0:07:02.880
to delete it some of my campers found

0:07:01.680,0:07:05.199
this already

0:07:02.880,0:07:07.759
there's a trash can icon over here and

0:07:05.199,0:07:10.800
if you click this trash can icon

0:07:07.759,0:07:11.680
the cat will be gone poof if you ever do

0:07:10.800,0:07:14.160
something like that on

0:07:11.680,0:07:15.599
accident campers how do you how do you

0:07:14.160,0:07:17.039
fix a problem if you did that on

0:07:15.599,0:07:19.520
accident

0:07:17.039,0:07:20.800
yeah command z or control z depending on

0:07:19.520,0:07:23.120
what type of computer you're on uh

0:07:20.800,0:07:26.960
that's undo so if i messed up i just hit

0:07:23.120,0:07:29.039
um control z or command z

0:07:26.960,0:07:30.800
oops that didn't work you can also go to

0:07:29.039,0:07:31.520
edit uh restore sprite and it'll just be

0:07:30.800,0:07:32.800
back right

0:07:31.520,0:07:35.520
i did want to delete them that was a

0:07:32.800,0:07:37.440
good thing to do but just know that undo

0:07:35.520,0:07:38.639
is very important uh with things you're

0:07:37.440,0:07:41.680
doing

0:07:38.639,0:07:43.840
all right now let's add a new sprite

0:07:41.680,0:07:44.879
i've got a sprite that i'm planning on

0:07:43.840,0:07:47.759
you're using

0:07:44.879,0:07:48.800
her name is avery walking so what we

0:07:47.759,0:07:51.759
want to do

0:07:48.800,0:07:52.560
is we want to add a new sprite to do

0:07:51.759,0:07:54.720
that

0:07:52.560,0:07:56.400
there's a circle down here for choose a

0:07:54.720,0:07:58.000
sprite

0:07:56.400,0:07:59.360
this circle confuses me a little bit

0:07:58.000,0:08:01.520
because what happens is when i hover

0:07:59.360,0:08:03.599
over it it like shoots up this thing

0:08:01.520,0:08:05.039
um it turns out you can ignore the thing

0:08:03.599,0:08:05.759
that pops up you can just click right on

0:08:05.039,0:08:07.520
the circle

0:08:05.759,0:08:08.479
so click right on the circle and what

0:08:07.520,0:08:10.000
we're going to do is we're going to add

0:08:08.479,0:08:12.560
a different sprite

0:08:10.000,0:08:14.639
instead of that cat and i'm looking for

0:08:12.560,0:08:16.479
one called avery walking

0:08:14.639,0:08:18.240
now i can see avery walking is right

0:08:16.479,0:08:20.080
here so i'm just going to select it

0:08:18.240,0:08:21.759
but just know that when you're looking

0:08:20.080,0:08:22.319
for sprites you can search for them in

0:08:21.759,0:08:24.479
here

0:08:22.319,0:08:25.599
you can also organize them by category

0:08:24.479,0:08:28.479
lots of options

0:08:25.599,0:08:29.599
but i want avery walking so when i click

0:08:28.479,0:08:34.000
on her

0:08:29.599,0:08:37.360
she's now into my scratch project

0:08:34.000,0:08:39.680
avery is looking pretty good

0:08:37.360,0:08:41.200
she's a little big so what i want to do

0:08:39.680,0:08:44.720
is i want to make her

0:08:41.200,0:08:46.000
a little smaller so right here is the

0:08:44.720,0:08:48.080
size

0:08:46.000,0:08:49.839
the size right now is set to 100 that

0:08:48.080,0:08:52.720
means 100 percent

0:08:49.839,0:08:53.440
of her normal size make her some amount

0:08:52.720,0:08:57.040
smaller

0:08:53.440,0:08:58.080
i'm going to go with 60. so now she'll

0:08:57.040,0:09:01.279
be able to

0:08:58.080,0:09:03.600
play this game better

0:09:01.279,0:09:05.440
right next to size you can see she's

0:09:03.600,0:09:06.160
also got what direction she's pointing

0:09:05.440,0:09:08.640
in

0:09:06.160,0:09:10.720
and you can kind of like move her around

0:09:08.640,0:09:12.480
like this

0:09:10.720,0:09:13.920
um which is kind of fun and after a

0:09:12.480,0:09:16.480
while you'll get dizzy

0:09:13.920,0:09:18.160
now sprites have different modes you can

0:09:16.480,0:09:20.399
see that right now her mode is that she

0:09:18.160,0:09:22.320
can point in any direction

0:09:20.399,0:09:23.440
i think she looks silly when she's like

0:09:22.320,0:09:26.480
walking up

0:09:23.440,0:09:28.320
um and so what i do is i switch her mode

0:09:26.480,0:09:30.720
right now the mode is set to any

0:09:28.320,0:09:32.080
directions called all around

0:09:30.720,0:09:34.240
you can also switch it to where she's

0:09:32.080,0:09:35.360
just left right or where she doesn't

0:09:34.240,0:09:37.600
rotate at all

0:09:35.360,0:09:39.600
i want to switch her mode to where she

0:09:37.600,0:09:41.760
just does left right

0:09:39.600,0:09:44.000
so i fixed her size so she's the right

0:09:41.760,0:09:46.080
size and then i switched her mode

0:09:44.000,0:09:47.519
to where she's just left right and so

0:09:46.080,0:09:49.519
now if she's pointing

0:09:47.519,0:09:51.360
anywhere to the left her sprite just

0:09:49.519,0:09:53.360
kind of looks like it's straight left

0:09:51.360,0:09:55.120
and if she's anywhere to the right she's

0:09:53.360,0:09:57.920
straight right so she's only got those

0:09:55.120,0:09:59.040
two options now it doesn't really matter

0:09:57.920,0:10:04.000
where you leave this arrow but i'm going

0:09:59.040,0:10:06.800
to put mine back to roughly 90 degrees

0:10:04.000,0:10:08.640
all right so avery is ready to go uh but

0:10:06.800,0:10:10.399
she has no code

0:10:08.640,0:10:13.680
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

0:10:10.399,0:10:15.680
gonna add a win green flag clicked

0:10:13.680,0:10:18.399
so i'm still in my events area so i can

0:10:15.680,0:10:20.480
just bring it over

0:10:18.399,0:10:23.360
and what we want avery to do is we want

0:10:20.480,0:10:26.160
her for to forever

0:10:23.360,0:10:27.440
move and follow the mouse so it's really

0:10:26.160,0:10:29.440
mean to tell people

0:10:27.440,0:10:30.800
uh to do something forever but in code

0:10:29.440,0:10:33.279
it happens all the time

0:10:30.800,0:10:34.320
so let's see if we can find the forever

0:10:33.279,0:10:35.920
statement

0:10:34.320,0:10:37.600
so the forever statement is in the

0:10:35.920,0:10:39.920
control category

0:10:37.600,0:10:41.760
control is just below events so you can

0:10:39.920,0:10:44.720
just scroll down there if you want

0:10:41.760,0:10:45.920
or you can click on this word control

0:10:44.720,0:10:48.320
and what you're doing is you're trying

0:10:45.920,0:10:49.920
to find a forever loop

0:10:48.320,0:10:51.760
so the forever loop it's the third one

0:10:49.920,0:10:52.480
down right here so just drag a forever

0:10:51.760,0:10:55.600
loop

0:10:52.480,0:10:57.360
and pop it into place so now when the

0:10:55.600,0:11:00.160
green flag is clicked

0:10:57.360,0:11:02.000
avery is going to do something forever

0:11:00.160,0:11:03.839
and right now the thing she does forever

0:11:02.000,0:11:05.519
is is nothing there's no code in there

0:11:03.839,0:11:07.440
let's add some code in there

0:11:05.519,0:11:11.360
the code we're going to add is up in

0:11:07.440,0:11:11.360
motion so go on motion

0:11:12.079,0:11:16.640
and find one that says point towards

0:11:15.120,0:11:18.000
mouse pointer

0:11:16.640,0:11:19.680
now this one's tricky because there's a

0:11:18.000,0:11:22.000
couple in here that are somewhere

0:11:19.680,0:11:24.399
uh but i want point towards mouse

0:11:22.000,0:11:24.399
pointer

0:11:25.600,0:11:30.160
some people accidentally grab like go to

0:11:28.720,0:11:32.240
or something like that but point towards

0:11:30.160,0:11:34.640
will do it so if we're pointing towards

0:11:32.240,0:11:37.120
the mouse pointer

0:11:34.640,0:11:38.560
when i run this program she should point

0:11:37.120,0:11:39.760
towards my mouse pointer now she only

0:11:38.560,0:11:41.600
points left or right

0:11:39.760,0:11:43.600
so when i run it and my mouse is over

0:11:41.600,0:11:45.440
here she points over here

0:11:43.600,0:11:46.800
and if my mouse goes on the other side

0:11:45.440,0:11:48.720
she switches direction

0:11:46.800,0:11:50.160
so she's pointing to the left she's

0:11:48.720,0:11:53.519
pointing towards the right

0:11:50.160,0:11:55.040
left right left right left right

0:11:53.519,0:11:56.720
you can also see that the code is

0:11:55.040,0:11:58.160
running in a couple of other ways first

0:11:56.720,0:11:59.360
it's outlined in yellow

0:11:58.160,0:12:01.440
so you can see that it's running because

0:11:59.360,0:12:02.880
it's outlined in yellow also the green

0:12:01.440,0:12:05.120
flag kind of appears that it's like

0:12:02.880,0:12:08.079
continually depressed

0:12:05.120,0:12:09.600
it's not sad it's just always pressed

0:12:08.079,0:12:11.519
all right

0:12:09.600,0:12:13.360
let's add some more code my camper's

0:12:11.519,0:12:15.760
doing okay

0:12:13.360,0:12:16.720
everybody good all right let's do some

0:12:15.760,0:12:20.000
movement

0:12:16.720,0:12:20.639
so just below that point towards add a

0:12:20.000,0:12:24.880
move

0:12:20.639,0:12:27.680
10 steps

0:12:24.880,0:12:28.720
and the value 10 determines how fast she

0:12:27.680,0:12:30.480
walks

0:12:28.720,0:12:33.680
so right now i'm going to go ahead and

0:12:30.480,0:12:38.399
run it and she's going to move towards

0:12:33.680,0:12:40.720
my mouse at 10.

0:12:38.399,0:12:42.399
if you want to play with speeds um every

0:12:40.720,0:12:44.959
every kid likes to do this right so you

0:12:42.399,0:12:47.040
can you can go faster

0:12:44.959,0:12:48.880
um but if she goes too fast it works out

0:12:47.040,0:12:50.959
badly right so everybody likes to do

0:12:48.880,0:12:53.839
that so i'm just showing it to you

0:12:50.959,0:12:57.040
you can go slower so if i go at two

0:12:53.839,0:12:57.040
she'll just go really slow

0:13:01.360,0:13:05.680
and i'm going to leave mine at 15 is

0:13:04.000,0:13:07.839
where i'm going to leave mine

0:13:05.680,0:13:11.040
that will appear to be kind of fast but

0:13:07.839,0:13:11.040
we're going to fix that in a minute

0:13:11.440,0:13:16.160
so you can play around with it but i'm

0:13:14.560,0:13:17.200
going to leave mine at 15 because i'm

0:13:16.160,0:13:18.240
going to do something

0:13:17.200,0:13:20.079
here in a minute that's going to make

0:13:18.240,0:13:22.639
that be the correct speed right now it's

0:13:20.079,0:13:22.639
a little fast

0:13:24.399,0:13:30.480
another problem that i have is avery

0:13:27.839,0:13:31.680
is gliding places right i want her to be

0:13:30.480,0:13:32.720
walking places

0:13:31.680,0:13:34.959
now i'm going to show you something

0:13:32.720,0:13:36.320
about avery avery has code

0:13:34.959,0:13:40.160
we can see her code here because we're

0:13:36.320,0:13:43.920
in the code tab avery also has costumes

0:13:40.160,0:13:46.079
and avery has sounds um what we

0:13:43.920,0:13:48.079
the reason we picked avery is because

0:13:46.079,0:13:50.399
she has four costumes

0:13:48.079,0:13:52.240
and if you cycle between those costumes

0:13:50.399,0:13:55.199
it'll look like she's walking

0:13:52.240,0:13:57.519
so if you picked avery then you can make

0:13:55.199,0:14:00.160
her look like she's walking

0:13:57.519,0:14:01.120
so let's let's do that let's go into

0:14:00.160,0:14:02.880
looks

0:14:01.120,0:14:04.320
because her costume like the way she

0:14:02.880,0:14:07.519
looks is in looks

0:14:04.320,0:14:10.560
and find this one called next costume

0:14:07.519,0:14:10.560
and put it on the bottom

0:14:10.800,0:14:13.839
now i'm going to warn you she's going to

0:14:12.160,0:14:15.760
walk really fast

0:14:13.839,0:14:18.480
so you can see that she walks quite

0:14:15.760,0:14:20.639
quickly as she's going around

0:14:18.480,0:14:21.519
and it's kind of comical to watch her

0:14:20.639,0:14:24.160
but it is a little

0:14:21.519,0:14:24.160
too fast

0:14:25.040,0:14:30.560
so how do we slow her down

0:14:28.480,0:14:33.040
so the way i want to slow her down is i

0:14:30.560,0:14:35.199
want to put in a short time delay

0:14:33.040,0:14:36.240
and so with a short time delay it'll

0:14:35.199,0:14:39.279
make her look

0:14:36.240,0:14:42.839
like she's walking not extremely fast

0:14:39.279,0:14:44.880
time delays are over in control so go to

0:14:42.839,0:14:47.920
control

0:14:44.880,0:14:49.600
take a wait one second

0:14:47.920,0:14:51.600
and put it down at the bottom of your

0:14:49.600,0:14:52.399
function the bottom of your forever loop

0:14:51.600,0:14:54.480
so now

0:14:52.399,0:14:56.000
we're pointing towards the mouse pointer

0:14:54.480,0:14:57.519
we're moving 10

0:14:56.000,0:14:59.839
we're switching costumes so she looks

0:14:57.519,0:15:02.480
like walks um and then we're waiting

0:14:59.839,0:15:05.680
one second you can try one second but

0:15:02.480,0:15:05.680
it's gonna be way too slow

0:15:06.399,0:15:11.639
that's quite painful and so i'm gonna

0:15:09.680,0:15:15.199
switch it to

0:15:11.639,0:15:15.199
0.1 seconds

0:15:16.800,0:15:20.880
that i think looks good enough for me

0:15:21.360,0:15:26.880
so she's walking around and it looks

0:15:24.480,0:15:28.079
like things are going well

0:15:26.880,0:15:29.759
i think i'm going to come around i'm

0:15:28.079,0:15:30.959
going to check on some of my campers to

0:15:29.759,0:15:32.560
see how they're doing

0:15:30.959,0:15:35.040
um and it'll give you a minute to get

0:15:32.560,0:15:37.440
caught up if you're falling behind

0:15:35.040,0:15:39.120
all right neil let's start with you um

0:15:37.440,0:15:40.959
so have you got yours caught up

0:15:39.120,0:15:42.480
oh neil is a little on the independent

0:15:40.959,0:15:44.320
side neila

0:15:42.480,0:15:45.600
put a big old horse in there instead of

0:15:44.320,0:15:47.600
avery walking

0:15:45.600,0:15:49.279
um it looks really good can you show

0:15:47.600,0:15:51.519
that he moves around so you do

0:15:49.279,0:15:54.079
the green flag there and then as you

0:15:51.519,0:15:57.600
move the mouse around it's going great

0:15:54.079,0:15:59.759
bowen oh what a bunch of rule followers

0:15:57.600,0:16:01.680
bowen's got a penguin on here hit it

0:15:59.759,0:16:03.519
bowen let's see yours oh and the penguin

0:16:01.680,0:16:06.240
oh that's kind of neat bowen the penguin

0:16:03.519,0:16:08.560
has a walking animation

0:16:06.240,0:16:09.920
great job you two five and seven you can

0:16:08.560,0:16:12.880
do it let's check on our

0:16:09.920,0:16:15.360
our older campers um so we've got

0:16:12.880,0:16:18.639
mckinley uh with an avery

0:16:15.360,0:16:22.320
yours is a little fast change it to 0.1

0:16:18.639,0:16:23.279
instead of zero one um and keegan's is

0:16:22.320,0:16:24.959
right there

0:16:23.279,0:16:26.959
mckinley says she knew what she was

0:16:24.959,0:16:27.440
supposed to do she just wanted it to be

0:16:26.959,0:16:30.399
fast

0:16:27.440,0:16:31.680
um i suppose that's okay all right so

0:16:30.399,0:16:34.160
the next thing we want to do

0:16:31.680,0:16:35.600
is uh avery's looking good uh avery's

0:16:34.160,0:16:37.759
walking around a white

0:16:35.600,0:16:39.120
space um let's go ahead and give her a

0:16:37.759,0:16:41.519
better background

0:16:39.120,0:16:43.440
so just like we added a sprite we're

0:16:41.519,0:16:44.800
going to add a backdrop

0:16:43.440,0:16:46.000
so in the lower right corner here

0:16:44.800,0:16:46.639
there's a circle that says choose

0:16:46.000,0:16:48.240
backdrop

0:16:46.639,0:16:50.720
go ahead and click on that circle in the

0:16:48.240,0:16:52.800
lower right corner

0:16:50.720,0:16:54.320
just like with sprites it'll take you to

0:16:52.800,0:16:55.759
a screen that lets you pick the one you

0:16:54.320,0:16:58.480
want

0:16:55.759,0:16:59.920
what i chose to do is i chose to do

0:16:58.480,0:17:01.920
bedroom one

0:16:59.920,0:17:04.079
because i thought that it would be good

0:17:01.920,0:17:05.120
to be able to hide things in there

0:17:04.079,0:17:07.439
and to kind of make it look like it's

0:17:05.120,0:17:08.799
part of the environment i don't mind if

0:17:07.439,0:17:11.520
you do something different

0:17:08.799,0:17:13.679
you can do whatever you want to do but

0:17:11.520,0:17:14.880
just pick one that you think you'd like

0:17:13.679,0:17:17.679
while you're picking that i'm going to

0:17:14.880,0:17:18.720
talk about backdrops just a little bit

0:17:17.679,0:17:20.799
the first thing i want to say about

0:17:18.720,0:17:22.640
backdrops is that you can see right now

0:17:20.799,0:17:23.439
that my sprite is selected and i can see

0:17:22.640,0:17:25.039
her code

0:17:23.439,0:17:28.079
if i ever accidentally click on the

0:17:25.039,0:17:29.520
stage now it shows my stages code so do

0:17:28.079,0:17:30.320
this for me go back and forth click on

0:17:29.520,0:17:31.679
your sprite

0:17:30.320,0:17:33.520
and you can see your sprites code is

0:17:31.679,0:17:36.000
here and then if you click on your

0:17:33.520,0:17:37.840
backdrop which is over here to the right

0:17:36.000,0:17:40.000
you can see the backdrops code which is

0:17:37.840,0:17:41.840
blank i only point that out because

0:17:40.000,0:17:42.960
sometimes people accidentally click over

0:17:41.840,0:17:44.240
there and they're like where did all my

0:17:42.960,0:17:47.360
code go

0:17:44.240,0:17:49.360
and it's because code can be different

0:17:47.360,0:17:50.720
for different sprites it can also be

0:17:49.360,0:17:52.240
different for the backdrop

0:17:50.720,0:17:54.960
and just know to bring your code back

0:17:52.240,0:17:58.240
all you have to do is click on avery

0:17:54.960,0:17:59.039
easy peasy all right let's add a new

0:17:58.240,0:18:01.200
sprite

0:17:59.039,0:18:02.720
so we want to add food for her to eat

0:18:01.200,0:18:04.320
alphabetically

0:18:02.720,0:18:06.160
and so this time i think it really would

0:18:04.320,0:18:07.520
be best if you follow along and you add

0:18:06.160,0:18:10.320
an apple

0:18:07.520,0:18:11.919
so click on choose sprite the circle

0:18:10.320,0:18:15.440
down here

0:18:11.919,0:18:17.039
and see if you can find an apple

0:18:15.440,0:18:19.360
now you can see that there's two

0:18:17.039,0:18:21.919
different sprites there's avery

0:18:19.360,0:18:23.039
and avery has code that we've written

0:18:21.919,0:18:25.520
and then there's an apple

0:18:23.039,0:18:27.039
which currently has no code at all and

0:18:25.520,0:18:28.400
you can go back and forth between them

0:18:27.039,0:18:30.320
pretty easily

0:18:28.400,0:18:32.240
the apple if you like its size you can

0:18:30.320,0:18:34.240
leave it i'm going to choose to make my

0:18:32.240,0:18:37.600
apple just a little bit smaller

0:18:34.240,0:18:40.000
maybe a 70 apple you can also put it

0:18:37.600,0:18:41.840
somewhere in your environment

0:18:40.000,0:18:43.520
maybe i'll do a 50 apple and put it on

0:18:41.840,0:18:45.039
the table to where it kind of looks like

0:18:43.520,0:18:46.160
it belongs so it's a little bit more

0:18:45.039,0:18:49.919
hidden

0:18:46.160,0:18:51.679
that's optional next let's write some

0:18:49.919,0:18:53.120
code for the apple

0:18:51.679,0:18:55.200
oh i just realized there's another

0:18:53.120,0:18:57.120
important thing that i forgot to do

0:18:55.200,0:18:58.559
whenever you're coding ask my campers

0:18:57.120,0:19:00.559
this what's an important thing to do

0:18:58.559,0:19:02.000
when you're coding campers

0:19:00.559,0:19:03.600
save it's important to save every so

0:19:02.000,0:19:05.440
often what i'm going to do is i'm going

0:19:03.600,0:19:07.600
to name my project

0:19:05.440,0:19:08.640
i'm going to name mine alphabet

0:19:07.600,0:19:10.320
breakfast

0:19:08.640,0:19:12.720
you can name your project anything you'd

0:19:10.320,0:19:14.559
like and it does auto

0:19:12.720,0:19:16.320
save but if you ever want to force it to

0:19:14.559,0:19:19.280
save you can click on file

0:19:16.320,0:19:20.880
save now so it will periodically auto

0:19:19.280,0:19:22.000
save so you don't have to keep hitting

0:19:20.880,0:19:23.200
file save now

0:19:22.000,0:19:24.720
but if you ever do something you're like

0:19:23.200,0:19:26.160
oh i want to make sure it's saved just

0:19:24.720,0:19:28.799
click on file save now

0:19:26.160,0:19:29.520
and you'll be sure that it saves back to

0:19:28.799,0:19:33.039
the apple

0:19:29.520,0:19:35.280
so the apple uh let's go ahead and do a

0:19:33.039,0:19:38.960
win green flag for for him as well so

0:19:35.280,0:19:41.520
click on events

0:19:38.960,0:19:43.200
when green flag clicked you'll find that

0:19:41.520,0:19:44.400
a lot of sprites start that way unless

0:19:43.200,0:19:46.799
you're doing something really advanced a

0:19:44.400,0:19:47.840
lot of them start this way

0:19:46.799,0:19:49.679
and what we're going to do with the

0:19:47.840,0:19:51.360
apple is we're going to decide to show

0:19:49.679,0:19:52.880
him or hide him so he's going to either

0:19:51.360,0:19:55.520
be shown or hidden

0:19:52.880,0:19:57.039
so the first thing i'm going to do is

0:19:55.520,0:19:59.360
i'm going to make sure he's shown

0:19:57.039,0:20:01.600
at when the program starts so go to

0:19:59.360,0:20:05.600
looks first

0:20:01.600,0:20:07.120
and find show now i know right now he's

0:20:05.600,0:20:08.799
shown and everything's fine

0:20:07.120,0:20:10.400
but periodically in this app he's going

0:20:08.799,0:20:11.360
to get hidden and i want to make sure he

0:20:10.400,0:20:14.080
starts off

0:20:11.360,0:20:14.080
being shown

0:20:14.480,0:20:18.159
now the next thing we want to do is we

0:20:16.080,0:20:19.840
want to forever

0:20:18.159,0:20:22.159
check to see if avery's touching the

0:20:19.840,0:20:24.559
apple so what i'm going to do next is

0:20:22.159,0:20:27.600
i'm going to add a forever loop

0:20:24.559,0:20:27.600
so i'm in control

0:20:28.000,0:20:31.120
and i drag a forever loop over

0:20:29.810,0:20:33.679
[Music]

0:20:31.120,0:20:34.640
all right now inside the forever loop we

0:20:33.679,0:20:38.000
want to check

0:20:34.640,0:20:39.760
if she's touching the apple this is one

0:20:38.000,0:20:41.760
of our our flow control statements it's

0:20:39.760,0:20:43.679
also uh in the control area

0:20:41.760,0:20:45.280
and it looks like this it's just an if

0:20:43.679,0:20:48.320
so drag this if over

0:20:45.280,0:20:50.000
and drop it inside the forever loop so

0:20:48.320,0:20:53.200
we're forever going to check

0:20:50.000,0:20:54.480
if something is happening now the way

0:20:53.200,0:20:56.799
you read this is it says

0:20:54.480,0:21:00.000
if and then this diamond shape is the

0:20:56.799,0:21:03.600
condition so if this condition is true

0:21:00.000,0:21:05.120
then run this code now let's find a good

0:21:03.600,0:21:08.799
condition to put in here

0:21:05.120,0:21:11.919
go into sensing so we want to sense

0:21:08.799,0:21:13.760
if we're touching avery or not

0:21:11.919,0:21:15.760
so this is kind of interesting but the

0:21:13.760,0:21:16.480
thing we want to drag into there is

0:21:15.760,0:21:19.600
actually

0:21:16.480,0:21:21.200
if touching mouse pointer

0:21:19.600,0:21:24.640
and the reason we're going to drag this

0:21:21.200,0:21:27.039
in is you see this white arrow on here

0:21:24.640,0:21:28.559
so this white arrow means that you can

0:21:27.039,0:21:31.039
probably change it

0:21:28.559,0:21:31.760
and sure enough you can change it to say

0:21:31.039,0:21:35.440
um if

0:21:31.760,0:21:38.880
touching avery walking so every walking

0:21:35.440,0:21:43.200
is the name of that other sprite

0:21:38.880,0:21:46.880
so um if touching avery walking

0:21:43.200,0:21:48.320
then we want to hide

0:21:46.880,0:21:50.720
hide is a command which is over and

0:21:48.320,0:21:50.720
looks

0:21:51.679,0:21:56.159
so we're going to bring in a hide and

0:21:53.440,0:21:56.159
drop it right there

0:21:57.600,0:22:00.720
so you can see that the apple has code

0:21:59.360,0:22:03.520
that it runs and

0:22:00.720,0:22:06.400
avery has code that she runs and if i

0:22:03.520,0:22:09.280
hit the green flag right now

0:22:06.400,0:22:11.360
avery's going to walk around and as soon

0:22:09.280,0:22:15.280
as she touches the apple

0:22:11.360,0:22:17.919
it disappears it's gone

0:22:15.280,0:22:21.600
and then if you stop your program and

0:22:17.919,0:22:21.600
restart it the apple comes back

0:22:22.400,0:22:27.760
cool i'd say it's going pretty well

0:22:25.760,0:22:28.880
another important thing with games is

0:22:27.760,0:22:31.440
that they're fun

0:22:28.880,0:22:32.799
right so right now the apple just just

0:22:31.440,0:22:34.640
disappears

0:22:32.799,0:22:36.320
i think it'd be more fun if our apple

0:22:34.640,0:22:38.960
made a little bit of noise

0:22:36.320,0:22:40.559
so our apple is going to make a noise

0:22:38.960,0:22:43.360
whenever we get it we're going to make a

0:22:40.559,0:22:43.360
chomp sound

0:22:43.440,0:22:48.000
all sprites have sounds that they

0:22:46.559,0:22:49.840
currently know about

0:22:48.000,0:22:52.159
let's click on the apple and let's see

0:22:49.840,0:22:54.159
what sounds it knows about

0:22:52.159,0:22:56.000
sure enough he has a sound called chomp

0:22:54.159,0:23:00.000
uh go ahead and play it

0:22:56.000,0:23:02.640
oh it kind of sounds like on the apple

0:23:00.000,0:23:04.080
so he already has the sound we want if

0:23:02.640,0:23:05.440
we wanted more sounds we could add him

0:23:04.080,0:23:06.960
but we don't need to for him he's got

0:23:05.440,0:23:08.720
the sound we want so let's go back to

0:23:06.960,0:23:11.090
our code

0:23:08.720,0:23:12.720
so in the code look for sound

0:23:11.090,0:23:15.760
[Music]

0:23:12.720,0:23:19.280
and what we want to do is we want to

0:23:15.760,0:23:19.280
play sound chomp

0:23:20.799,0:23:24.480
now there's a couple versions of this

0:23:22.480,0:23:25.280
there's play sound until done and then

0:23:24.480,0:23:27.039
there's start

0:23:25.280,0:23:28.559
sound chomp in this case it doesn't

0:23:27.039,0:23:29.840
matter you can put in either one that

0:23:28.559,0:23:32.720
you'd want

0:23:29.840,0:23:34.799
um so let's go ahead and run it again

0:23:32.720,0:23:36.960
and now when we hit the apple

0:23:34.799,0:23:38.960
it should make a home chomp sound which

0:23:36.960,0:23:40.159
is kind of fun

0:23:38.960,0:23:42.000
i don't know if you can hear the chomp

0:23:40.159,0:23:43.039
on the video as well but mine worked

0:23:42.000,0:23:44.559
really nicely

0:23:43.039,0:23:47.520
all right the next thing we're going to

0:23:44.559,0:23:50.320
do is we're going to add a variable

0:23:47.520,0:23:52.159
so if you remember the main game what it

0:23:50.320,0:23:53.840
did is it had many

0:23:52.159,0:23:56.080
many different things you had to eat

0:23:53.840,0:23:57.520
right and we had to know

0:23:56.080,0:23:58.720
was it time to eat the apple or not

0:23:57.520,0:23:59.279
because we tried to eat the bananas

0:23:58.720,0:24:01.679
first

0:23:59.279,0:24:02.640
it would say keep trying food should be

0:24:01.679,0:24:04.960
alphabetically

0:24:02.640,0:24:06.400
but if you eat the apple first then it

0:24:04.960,0:24:09.120
should work right

0:24:06.400,0:24:11.200
and so what we need to do is we need to

0:24:09.120,0:24:14.000
keep track of the state of the game

0:24:11.200,0:24:19.520
the state of the game is a variable so

0:24:14.000,0:24:23.840
do this click on variables for me

0:24:19.520,0:24:23.840
and click on make a variable

0:24:24.720,0:24:29.919
i'm going to name this variable food

0:24:28.640,0:24:32.799
you can see that there's a couple

0:24:29.919,0:24:34.080
options here it says for all sprites or

0:24:32.799,0:24:35.760
for this sprite only

0:24:34.080,0:24:38.400
this variable is for everybody in the

0:24:35.760,0:24:39.760
whole world so the default of for all

0:24:38.400,0:24:41.840
sprites was correct

0:24:39.760,0:24:42.870
so i just need to type the word food and

0:24:41.840,0:24:45.200
then hit ok

0:24:42.870,0:24:47.360
[Music]

0:24:45.200,0:24:49.520
now with variables um you can see that

0:24:47.360,0:24:50.960
it shows it up here it says food zero

0:24:49.520,0:24:52.880
there's a couple things that we always

0:24:50.960,0:24:55.279
do with variables we always want to

0:24:52.880,0:24:56.000
set their initial value we want to

0:24:55.279,0:24:57.600
update them

0:24:56.000,0:24:59.360
at an appropriate time and then we want

0:24:57.600,0:25:01.840
to use them so

0:24:59.360,0:25:03.440
i want to set food to be one so i want

0:25:01.840,0:25:04.559
to set it to one when this program

0:25:03.440,0:25:06.080
starts up

0:25:04.559,0:25:08.559
i'm going to choose to put that code on

0:25:06.080,0:25:10.320
avery so click on avery

0:25:08.559,0:25:12.000
and so now we're back over in avery's

0:25:10.320,0:25:14.400
code

0:25:12.000,0:25:15.919
and let's add some code to her what i

0:25:14.400,0:25:18.880
want to do is i want to add

0:25:15.919,0:25:19.360
set food to and so i'm going to drag

0:25:18.880,0:25:21.520
this

0:25:19.360,0:25:24.320
and i'm going to put it before the

0:25:21.520,0:25:26.559
forever loop

0:25:24.320,0:25:28.559
now just for fun that's where it goes

0:25:26.559,0:25:30.799
you should put it right there i'm gonna

0:25:28.559,0:25:32.799
i'm gonna pretend like i made a mistake

0:25:30.799,0:25:35.120
and show you how to fix a mistake

0:25:32.799,0:25:36.080
so one thing that happens all the time

0:25:35.120,0:25:38.400
when you're coding

0:25:36.080,0:25:40.720
is you drop things in the wrong spot and

0:25:38.400,0:25:43.200
so let's say i drop this right here

0:25:40.720,0:25:44.799
oh no that's that's the wrong spot um so

0:25:43.200,0:25:46.799
the question is how do i fix it

0:25:44.799,0:25:49.120
the way you do it is you you drag it

0:25:46.799,0:25:49.520
over it brings everybody below it with

0:25:49.120,0:25:51.520
it

0:25:49.520,0:25:53.039
and then you drag the things that you

0:25:51.520,0:25:54.400
wanted back right so it's kind of a

0:25:53.039,0:25:56.080
two-step process

0:25:54.400,0:25:57.760
you'll get used to it with scratch so

0:25:56.080,0:25:59.520
where i want it is right here

0:25:57.760,0:26:01.200
and i want to set its initial value to

0:25:59.520,0:26:03.600
1.

0:26:01.200,0:26:05.840
hey also while i'm over here let's go

0:26:03.600,0:26:08.159
ahead and make sure that avery starts in

0:26:05.840,0:26:10.400
the same spot each time in the game

0:26:08.159,0:26:11.760
so put avery to wherever you want her to

0:26:10.400,0:26:14.960
start at i'm going to have her start in

0:26:11.760,0:26:14.960
the bottom of her room here

0:26:15.679,0:26:24.159
and i want her to start there so that's

0:26:18.480,0:26:27.440
a motion command so click on motion

0:26:24.159,0:26:29.039
so i want the command go to x y

0:26:27.440,0:26:30.880
and i want to drop it in here at the

0:26:29.039,0:26:33.200
same time i set the variable

0:26:30.880,0:26:34.960
i'm going to set her initial position

0:26:33.200,0:26:36.400
your numbers don't have to be the same

0:26:34.960,0:26:38.240
as mine

0:26:36.400,0:26:39.679
and the nice thing about scratch is if

0:26:38.240,0:26:41.919
you've got her where you want her

0:26:39.679,0:26:43.919
um those it's called the arguments will

0:26:41.919,0:26:45.919
get set correctly right so wherever

0:26:43.919,0:26:47.520
you put her in the right spot first then

0:26:45.919,0:26:49.520
you drag this command over

0:26:47.520,0:26:51.520
and things will work quite nicely so

0:26:49.520,0:26:53.520
starter somewhere weird

0:26:51.520,0:26:55.120
hit the green flag and you'll notice

0:26:53.520,0:26:56.960
that she'll go to your starting spot

0:26:55.120,0:26:59.200
each time so no matter where she's at

0:26:56.960,0:27:01.279
she'll go back to your starting spot all

0:26:59.200,0:27:02.640
right so this variable we made it we set

0:27:01.279,0:27:04.720
its initial value

0:27:02.640,0:27:06.000
um now let's see if we can change it at

0:27:04.720,0:27:11.039
an appropriate time

0:27:06.000,0:27:13.679
click on your apple so your apple

0:27:11.039,0:27:15.440
if he's touching avery he needs to hide

0:27:13.679,0:27:16.720
he needs to make a chomp sound

0:27:15.440,0:27:18.159
by the way the order of those two

0:27:16.720,0:27:19.520
commands doesn't matter at all you can

0:27:18.159,0:27:21.760
have it swapped and that's fine

0:27:19.520,0:27:22.170
the other thing we want to do is we want

0:27:21.760,0:27:23.440
to

0:27:22.170,0:27:25.760
[Music]

0:27:23.440,0:27:26.880
increment the variable so let's just go

0:27:25.760,0:27:30.000
ahead and

0:27:26.880,0:27:30.000
quickly go to variables

0:27:30.640,0:27:36.960
and find change food by one

0:27:34.000,0:27:36.960
and drop it in here

0:27:37.660,0:27:42.399
[Music]

0:27:39.360,0:27:44.320
so let's go ahead and run it again and

0:27:42.399,0:27:45.919
this won't be that exciting but if you

0:27:44.320,0:27:49.039
notice food is currently one

0:27:45.919,0:27:49.760
but after i eat the apple food changes

0:27:49.039,0:27:54.960
to two

0:27:49.760,0:27:54.960
right so things are going pretty good

0:27:55.279,0:27:59.200
now the next thing we're going to do is

0:27:56.480,0:28:00.480
a little tricky so i want to only be

0:27:59.200,0:28:02.480
able to eat the apple

0:28:00.480,0:28:03.679
if food is currently one so here's what

0:28:02.480,0:28:05.600
i'm going to do

0:28:03.679,0:28:07.039
i'm going to take the code that i've got

0:28:05.600,0:28:10.240
in here

0:28:07.039,0:28:11.760
and i'm going to set it over to the side

0:28:10.240,0:28:14.320
so i still want that code but i'm just

0:28:11.760,0:28:15.760
going to set it over to the side

0:28:14.320,0:28:18.480
now what i want to do is i want to have

0:28:15.760,0:28:19.840
an if else statement

0:28:18.480,0:28:22.480
so we've we've learned about if

0:28:19.840,0:28:24.000
statements they were over in control

0:28:22.480,0:28:25.600
and this time what we want is we want

0:28:24.000,0:28:27.039
the more complex version it kind of

0:28:25.600,0:28:32.240
looks like a big letter e

0:28:27.039,0:28:32.240
and put in uh an if else statement

0:28:37.120,0:28:40.480
and so when we're touching avery we want

0:28:39.120,0:28:43.520
to check

0:28:40.480,0:28:44.159
is food equal to the correct number and

0:28:43.520,0:28:46.799
in this case

0:28:44.159,0:28:48.159
one so if food is equal to one we want

0:28:46.799,0:28:50.559
to let you eat it

0:28:48.159,0:28:51.919
if food is not one then we want to show

0:28:50.559,0:28:53.360
like an error message

0:28:51.919,0:28:56.480
so here's what we're gonna do we're

0:28:53.360,0:28:56.480
gonna go to operators

0:28:57.520,0:29:01.200
and we're going to find the one that

0:28:58.720,0:29:03.440
says equals it's about six or seven down

0:29:01.200,0:29:03.440
here

0:29:06.420,0:29:12.640
[Music]

0:29:09.360,0:29:14.640
and so if our variable food is equal to

0:29:12.640,0:29:16.640
the apples the first thing so if our

0:29:14.640,0:29:18.240
variable food is equal to one

0:29:16.640,0:29:20.799
then we're going to do stuff go into

0:29:18.240,0:29:20.799
variables

0:29:20.880,0:29:25.200
and drag food into that other white

0:29:23.039,0:29:26.720
circle

0:29:25.200,0:29:28.320
i did that kind of fast so if you need

0:29:26.720,0:29:30.399
to pause the video that's fine

0:29:28.320,0:29:31.919
but i went into operators and i grabbed

0:29:30.399,0:29:33.919
this equals

0:29:31.919,0:29:35.679
i changed the right hand side to be one

0:29:33.919,0:29:36.960
then i went into variables and i grabbed

0:29:35.679,0:29:37.360
food and i put that on the left hand

0:29:36.960,0:29:40.559
side

0:29:37.360,0:29:42.080
so if food is one then i want to do this

0:29:40.559,0:29:45.360
stuff that we were doing over here so

0:29:42.080,0:29:45.360
i'm going to drop this into the top

0:29:50.880,0:29:55.039
now what should we do if food is not one

0:29:53.679,0:29:56.559
does anybody want to say what we should

0:29:55.039,0:29:59.039
do if food is not one bowen do you have

0:29:56.559,0:30:00.559
any ideas

0:29:59.039,0:30:02.880
do you remember what uh what this

0:30:00.559,0:30:03.840
program did so if i tried to eat the

0:30:02.880,0:30:07.520
banana

0:30:03.840,0:30:09.840
what did it say yeah so if it's not the

0:30:07.520,0:30:11.730
right time we want to say a message

0:30:09.840,0:30:13.440
so let's go into looks

0:30:11.730,0:30:16.320
[Music]

0:30:13.440,0:30:18.720
um and grab this say hello for two

0:30:16.320,0:30:18.720
seconds

0:30:18.799,0:30:21.760
and then you should probably have an

0:30:20.159,0:30:23.600
adult type your message because it takes

0:30:21.760,0:30:24.880
forever to type

0:30:23.600,0:30:27.919
so what i'm going to say is i'm going to

0:30:24.880,0:30:27.919
say keep trying

0:30:28.640,0:30:32.159
oops sorry i'm going to say keep trying

0:30:31.039,0:30:35.320
and then i'll say

0:30:32.159,0:30:38.320
food should be eaten

0:30:35.320,0:30:38.320
alphabetically

0:30:39.360,0:30:44.320
now have an adult type that for you

0:30:41.679,0:30:46.399
because it takes a while to type

0:30:44.320,0:30:47.440
all right so let's go ahead and try it

0:30:46.399,0:30:49.440
now this time

0:30:47.440,0:30:51.120
we only have one food it's the apple

0:30:49.440,0:30:51.679
it's the correct time to eat the apple

0:30:51.120,0:30:54.720
so if you

0:30:51.679,0:30:56.480
if you hit the apple it should go chomp

0:30:54.720,0:30:58.480
and it should be successful we've never

0:30:56.480,0:31:01.039
seen this message still

0:30:58.480,0:31:02.000
let's make another sprite let's add some

0:31:01.039,0:31:03.600
bananas

0:31:02.000,0:31:06.000
so to add another sprite this is kind of

0:31:03.600,0:31:07.840
a review click on this green circle down

0:31:06.000,0:31:10.480
here

0:31:07.840,0:31:12.159
um and find the bananas uh for me it's

0:31:10.480,0:31:13.519
still pretty high in the order

0:31:12.159,0:31:15.760
by the way eventually we're going to go

0:31:13.519,0:31:16.880
to the food category and this will have

0:31:15.760,0:31:18.399
all the different foods we're going to

0:31:16.880,0:31:20.399
eat so i'm going to go with banana

0:31:18.399,0:31:22.399
if you want to do bread bread also

0:31:20.399,0:31:24.240
starts with b that'd be fine

0:31:22.399,0:31:25.600
if you want to eat a bowl i suppose you

0:31:24.240,0:31:28.000
could but i wouldn't recommend eating

0:31:25.600,0:31:28.000
bowls

0:31:28.159,0:31:32.000
i'm going to decide where the bananas

0:31:29.919,0:31:33.519
need to go into my figure i'm going to

0:31:32.000,0:31:34.960
make them a little sneaky

0:31:33.519,0:31:38.320
i'm going to say that these bananas are

0:31:34.960,0:31:38.320
sitting over here at the edge of the bed

0:31:38.480,0:31:44.080
now what we want to do is the bananas

0:31:41.919,0:31:45.200
need to have all the same code that the

0:31:44.080,0:31:47.760
apple had

0:31:45.200,0:31:49.600
the only thing that's different is

0:31:47.760,0:31:50.720
whether this food is equal to one or

0:31:49.600,0:31:52.799
food is equal to two

0:31:50.720,0:31:53.919
but it's mostly the exact same i do not

0:31:52.799,0:31:55.679
want to type it all

0:31:53.919,0:31:57.360
and sprite has a real or scratch has a

0:31:55.679,0:32:01.200
really good trick for this

0:31:57.360,0:32:02.480
go to the apple and drag the code from

0:32:01.200,0:32:05.200
the apple

0:32:02.480,0:32:07.039
and drop it right here on the banana it

0:32:05.200,0:32:08.320
takes a little bit of getting used to

0:32:07.039,0:32:10.399
and you can see that whenever i did it

0:32:08.320,0:32:12.240
the banana kind of wiggled a little

0:32:10.399,0:32:14.640
and so if i drop it right there now it

0:32:12.240,0:32:16.799
it it's a copy paste is what happened

0:32:14.640,0:32:18.960
so now if i go to my apple i can see

0:32:16.799,0:32:21.120
that my apple has this code

0:32:18.960,0:32:22.880
and if i go to my banana the banana has

0:32:21.120,0:32:25.519
this code i can tell that neel is

0:32:22.880,0:32:28.559
struggling with this drag and drop

0:32:25.519,0:32:30.720
mommy may have to help her some so both

0:32:28.559,0:32:32.320
of them have the same code

0:32:30.720,0:32:34.480
there's one thing that needs to be

0:32:32.320,0:32:37.440
different and it's this

0:32:34.480,0:32:38.480
if food is equal to one the banana is

0:32:37.440,0:32:43.840
the second food

0:32:38.480,0:32:43.840
right so change it to a two

0:32:43.919,0:32:50.799
let's try it again so now

0:32:48.080,0:32:52.159
if i try to eat the banana first um

0:32:50.799,0:32:56.000
it'll say keep drying

0:32:52.159,0:32:58.640
food should be alphabetically

0:32:56.000,0:33:00.320
i try to eat the apple first it'll eat

0:32:58.640,0:33:02.720
it

0:33:00.320,0:33:04.159
now i'm going to go eat the banana wow

0:33:02.720,0:33:06.559
so you can see it worked if we did the

0:33:04.159,0:33:08.080
banana

0:33:06.559,0:33:10.000
now we're going to mass produce some

0:33:08.080,0:33:12.480
food and my goal is for you

0:33:10.000,0:33:13.919
to do this on your own i'm going to help

0:33:12.480,0:33:15.200
you kind of sort it with one more

0:33:13.919,0:33:17.039
and then i want you to just kind of make

0:33:15.200,0:33:19.279
a whole bunch so

0:33:17.039,0:33:20.159
to add the c i'm just going to do it

0:33:19.279,0:33:23.039
quickly here

0:33:20.159,0:33:24.799
i'm going to say choose a sprite i'm

0:33:23.039,0:33:26.880
going to click on food

0:33:24.799,0:33:29.600
and i'm going to pick a seafood i'm

0:33:26.880,0:33:32.799
going to pick cake

0:33:29.600,0:33:32.799
so now the cake is in here

0:33:32.880,0:33:39.279
and now i'm going to arrange the cake to

0:33:34.880,0:33:42.399
be a certain size

0:33:39.279,0:33:44.080
the cake then needs the same code

0:33:42.399,0:33:46.399
so i'm going to drag the code onto the

0:33:44.080,0:33:46.399
cake

0:33:48.240,0:33:53.200
and the cake is the third food so i

0:33:50.080,0:33:56.080
switch it to a three

0:33:53.200,0:33:57.760
so i want you to mass produce that for a

0:33:56.080,0:33:58.159
couple different fruits maybe go out to

0:33:57.760,0:33:59.440
like

0:33:58.159,0:34:01.679
egg or if you want to you can go to

0:33:59.440,0:34:03.440
fortune cookie there's there's one

0:34:01.679,0:34:06.000
problem still with the sound

0:34:03.440,0:34:07.600
but we'll we'll fix that so i'm going to

0:34:06.000,0:34:09.040
pause the video

0:34:07.600,0:34:10.720
i'm going to let you add all the foods

0:34:09.040,0:34:12.639
that you want to add

0:34:10.720,0:34:14.399
and then we're going to fix the sounds

0:34:12.639,0:34:16.480
together after you add them so pause the

0:34:14.399,0:34:18.240
video and go add your foods

0:34:16.480,0:34:20.000
all right so our family had to take a

0:34:18.240,0:34:21.200
little break maybe you guys it's a good

0:34:20.000,0:34:24.079
time to take a break as well but

0:34:21.200,0:34:25.839
um i got mine added um so i've got apple

0:34:24.079,0:34:28.000
and it says food one check yours with me

0:34:25.839,0:34:29.919
so make sure your apple says food one

0:34:28.000,0:34:31.440
then click on your banana make sure it

0:34:29.919,0:34:33.440
says food too

0:34:31.440,0:34:34.800
your cake or whatever c you've got food

0:34:33.440,0:34:38.399
three

0:34:34.800,0:34:41.919
donut for egg

0:34:38.399,0:34:44.960
five fortune cookie six

0:34:41.919,0:34:45.599
now if you try it um it will work right

0:34:44.960,0:34:48.720
now

0:34:45.599,0:34:49.839
but the sounds may not work so when i

0:34:48.720,0:34:52.639
eat my apple

0:34:49.839,0:34:53.839
uh where did my apple go to my apple's

0:34:52.639,0:34:57.040
right underneath my cake

0:34:53.839,0:35:00.240
um when i eat my apple it made noise

0:34:57.040,0:35:02.320
my banana actually made noise but then

0:35:00.240,0:35:05.119
after that they quit making noise um

0:35:02.320,0:35:07.680
so why did that oh the donut made noise

0:35:05.119,0:35:08.960
um so why do some make noise and others

0:35:07.680,0:35:11.040
don't make noise

0:35:08.960,0:35:13.119
i'm gonna also move my cake a little bit

0:35:11.040,0:35:15.680
because my cake and my apple were

0:35:13.119,0:35:17.119
right on top of each other by the way

0:35:15.680,0:35:17.760
one trick for bringing them all back is

0:35:17.119,0:35:19.520
if you just hit

0:35:17.760,0:35:21.280
start and then stop immediately then

0:35:19.520,0:35:22.079
they all come back right so i like that

0:35:21.280,0:35:24.560
trick

0:35:22.079,0:35:26.160
so that you can actually see things so

0:35:24.560,0:35:29.040
why didn't they make noise

0:35:26.160,0:35:30.240
so the apple you can see it says start

0:35:29.040,0:35:32.320
sound chomp

0:35:30.240,0:35:35.040
and then if you go to his tab he's got a

0:35:32.320,0:35:37.440
chomp sound so he's going to work fine

0:35:35.040,0:35:38.480
banana actually has the same code he

0:35:37.440,0:35:40.320
plays chomp

0:35:38.480,0:35:42.560
but you can see his sounds may not have

0:35:40.320,0:35:44.880
a chomp in it so what we want to do is

0:35:42.560,0:35:47.599
on the banana i want to switch it to

0:35:44.880,0:35:49.119
a sound that he does have so he has bite

0:35:47.599,0:35:50.720
on cake

0:35:49.119,0:35:52.640
instead of chomp i want to switch it to

0:35:50.720,0:35:53.520
a sound he does have i'm going to play

0:35:52.640,0:35:54.880
birthday

0:35:53.520,0:35:57.359
which is actually a little long but

0:35:54.880,0:35:59.119
that's okay donut

0:35:57.359,0:36:00.960
instead of chomp i want i'll go with

0:35:59.119,0:36:02.400
bite

0:36:00.960,0:36:04.000
egg i think you see the pattern so

0:36:02.400,0:36:04.640
switch it to a sound he does have egg

0:36:04.000,0:36:07.200
has pop

0:36:04.640,0:36:09.680
that's fine and fortune cookie what's

0:36:07.200,0:36:11.920
fortune cookie guy he's got pop

0:36:09.680,0:36:13.359
oh oh well if you wanted to add more

0:36:11.920,0:36:14.480
sounds you could play around in the

0:36:13.359,0:36:16.160
sound tab

0:36:14.480,0:36:18.000
but i quickly lose half an hour when i

0:36:16.160,0:36:19.280
let my kids go play the sound tab

0:36:18.000,0:36:21.359
um so we're just going to fix it like

0:36:19.280,0:36:22.800
that so now they should all make noise

0:36:21.359,0:36:25.440
so my campers are going to make a ton of

0:36:22.800,0:36:28.480
noise here so i get the apple

0:36:25.440,0:36:30.320
um banana

0:36:28.480,0:36:32.560
birthday you're gonna hear for like an

0:36:30.320,0:36:32.560
hour

0:36:33.620,0:36:37.780
[Music]

0:36:38.000,0:36:44.320
ah donut egg

0:36:41.200,0:36:46.560
fortune cookie cool so i think that

0:36:44.320,0:36:48.640
worked pretty well

0:36:46.560,0:36:50.400
one advanced thing you can do by the way

0:36:48.640,0:36:51.760
on on the birthday cake its song was

0:36:50.400,0:36:53.280
kind of long

0:36:51.760,0:36:54.320
so you don't have to do this this is

0:36:53.280,0:36:55.760
optional i'm going to go into the

0:36:54.320,0:36:57.839
birthday cake and the sounds

0:36:55.760,0:36:59.440
and i'm going to click faster a few

0:36:57.839,0:37:01.119
times

0:36:59.440,0:37:03.920
and so it'll play a nice fast happy

0:37:01.119,0:37:06.560
birthday but it was taken too long

0:37:03.920,0:37:07.680
so i went into the sounds on cake and i

0:37:06.560,0:37:12.320
clicked faster

0:37:07.680,0:37:13.920
one or two times right all right

0:37:12.320,0:37:16.320
we're gonna add one more feature you

0:37:13.920,0:37:18.960
guys up for one more feature

0:37:16.320,0:37:20.640
one more feature when the game is over

0:37:18.960,0:37:22.400
nothing happens

0:37:20.640,0:37:23.680
and it would be kind of nice if

0:37:22.400,0:37:26.079
something happened

0:37:23.680,0:37:27.280
that said like congratulations or a

0:37:26.079,0:37:28.880
great job or you win

0:37:27.280,0:37:30.880
or something like that so we're going to

0:37:28.880,0:37:33.520
add one more piece of code

0:37:30.880,0:37:35.440
to avery so click on your avery sprite

0:37:33.520,0:37:37.040
her code should look like this

0:37:35.440,0:37:38.720
and we're going to add an if statement

0:37:37.040,0:37:41.359
in here so the if statements were over

0:37:38.720,0:37:41.359
in control

0:37:41.680,0:37:46.000
in the control area find if

0:37:47.040,0:37:50.240
and just like we did for all the foods

0:37:48.640,0:37:52.320
we're going to see if that variable

0:37:50.240,0:37:53.760
is a certain number you can see that i

0:37:52.320,0:37:56.720
had six foods

0:37:53.760,0:37:57.920
so my variable ends at a seven so for

0:37:56.720,0:38:01.599
avery

0:37:57.920,0:38:03.440
i'm gonna say if food is equal to seven

0:38:01.599,0:38:05.040
then i'm gonna play congratulations you

0:38:03.440,0:38:07.839
win things like that so i'm going to go

0:38:05.040,0:38:07.839
to operators

0:38:08.160,0:38:14.160
i'm going to find the equals operator

0:38:11.599,0:38:17.280
this is just like we did before i'm

0:38:14.160,0:38:17.280
going to do variables

0:38:17.680,0:38:21.440
i'm gonna do food is equal to seven

0:38:21.599,0:38:24.079
all right so i've got that in there if

0:38:22.960,0:38:25.359
you ever need to pause it by the way

0:38:24.079,0:38:25.920
just pause the video and put that in

0:38:25.359,0:38:27.680
there

0:38:25.920,0:38:30.359
so when we win the game we want to do a

0:38:27.680,0:38:31.680
couple things first i want to say

0:38:30.359,0:38:36.160
congratulations

0:38:31.680,0:38:36.160
so saying things is over in looks

0:38:36.800,0:38:40.079
and i this time i do care which i grab i

0:38:39.119,0:38:42.720
want to make sure to grab

0:38:40.079,0:38:46.000
say hello without any time delay on it

0:38:42.720,0:38:48.000
so i just want to say say hello

0:38:46.000,0:38:49.520
and you can put whatever congratulations

0:38:48.000,0:38:51.040
message you want again you might want to

0:38:49.520,0:38:53.680
have an adult type for you

0:38:51.040,0:38:56.160
so i'm going to say you win alphabet

0:38:53.680,0:38:56.160
breakfast

0:38:56.960,0:39:00.000
so type whatever message you'd like and

0:38:59.119,0:39:01.839
make sure it's the version

0:39:00.000,0:39:03.680
that doesn't have the delay on it

0:39:01.839,0:39:05.520
alright so i typed that for my camper

0:39:03.680,0:39:08.880
now we're ready to add a sound

0:39:05.520,0:39:11.359
now avery only has the sound of pop

0:39:08.880,0:39:12.160
that's not good enough i want a funner

0:39:11.359,0:39:14.960
sound

0:39:12.160,0:39:16.000
so make sure you've got avery selected

0:39:14.960,0:39:18.800
go to her sound

0:39:16.000,0:39:20.800
area and let's add a new sound so come

0:39:18.800,0:39:24.079
down here to the lower left corner

0:39:20.800,0:39:24.079
and say choose a sound

0:39:24.160,0:39:28.079
and the sound i want you to add is dance

0:39:26.839,0:39:30.240
celebration

0:39:28.079,0:39:31.440
so there's a couple ways to find dance

0:39:30.240,0:39:33.440
celebration

0:39:31.440,0:39:35.280
i chose to type in part of the word

0:39:33.440,0:39:36.160
dance because i knew that it was one of

0:39:35.280,0:39:37.839
the options

0:39:36.160,0:39:39.440
and i can see right here the second one

0:39:37.839,0:39:40.640
is dance celebration

0:39:39.440,0:39:43.440
so i'm going to click in the middle of

0:39:40.640,0:39:46.480
this white box

0:39:43.440,0:39:48.800
now that i've added the sound avery can

0:39:46.480,0:39:51.440
now play the sound in our code right

0:39:48.800,0:39:53.599
so i've added the sound here then i go

0:39:51.440,0:39:56.880
into the code

0:39:53.599,0:39:57.680
and on sounds this time i want play

0:39:56.880,0:40:00.720
sound

0:39:57.680,0:40:01.920
until done so i'm going to play this

0:40:00.720,0:40:03.599
sound

0:40:01.920,0:40:07.119
and it defaulted to dance celebration

0:40:03.599,0:40:08.720
for me which was nice until done

0:40:07.119,0:40:11.760
and then the very last thing i'm going

0:40:08.720,0:40:17.040
to do is i'm going to end the program

0:40:11.760,0:40:17.040
so after i drag on play sound until done

0:40:17.440,0:40:24.319
i'm the last going to grab a stop all

0:40:20.880,0:40:27.040
so it's in control it's near the bottom

0:40:24.319,0:40:29.040

so it needs to go i'm inside this inner

0:40:31.680,0:40:35.359
loop

0:40:32.400,0:40:36.800
and that's our last line of code so it's

0:40:35.359,0:40:37.920
time to try it

0:40:36.800,0:40:39.839
and then i'm going to walk around i'm

0:43:35.440,0:43:38.640
right

0:43:36.800,0:43:40.800
i want to say one last thing before we

0:43:38.640,0:43:41.119
let you go so campers you can just kind

0:43:40.800,0:43:44.160
of

0:43:41.119,0:43:46.079
bear with me and listen if you want to

0:43:44.160,0:43:48.160

0:43:46.079,0:43:50.400
the word share here

0:43:48.160,0:43:51.680
and it'll make a public page that other

0:43:50.400,0:43:54.560
people can look at

you do have to be signed in to do that

0:43:54.560,0:43:57.920
and then this url right here you could

0:43:56.160,0:43:59.440
send to a friend or family

0:43:57.920,0:44:02.480
and then they could see your project as

0:43:59.440,0:44:04.400
well so i think that's all i've got

0:44:02.480,0:44:06.480
um really i just wanted to make sure

0:44:04.400,0:44:09.200
that you know a couple things

0:44:06.480,0:44:10.400
you can sit on my lap first off is

0:44:09.200,0:44:13.280
coding is fun

0:44:10.400,0:44:15.760
uh you can totally do it neela is five

0:44:13.280,0:44:18.240
this is her first coding experience ever

0:44:15.760,0:44:19.200
um and she's learning little bits at a

0:44:18.240,0:44:20.560
time right

0:44:19.200,0:44:22.800
but we hopefully know that different

0:44:20.560,0:44:25.040
sprites have different code

0:44:22.800,0:44:26.800
the code runs in order and there's lots

0:44:25.040,0:44:29.200
of great things we learned today

0:44:26.800,0:44:30.960
but we've got a whole week of this and

0:44:29.200,0:44:32.000
each day will hopefully get easier and

0:44:30.960,0:44:34.000
easier for you

0:44:32.000,0:44:35.520
so we loved having you join us we hope

0:44:34.000,0:44:37.490
