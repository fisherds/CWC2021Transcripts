0:00:04.640,0:00:07.680
hey hey

0:00:05.200,0:00:10.320
welcome to connecting with code uh the

0:00:07.680,0:00:11.519
way this camp works is it is a video uh

0:00:10.320,0:00:13.440
which you're watching now

0:00:11.519,0:00:15.200
um and you try to follow along with this

0:00:13.440,0:00:16.400
video to do the same things that i'm

0:00:15.200,0:00:17.039
doing so you actually like work the

0:00:16.400,0:00:18.320
video

0:00:17.039,0:00:20.640
and you learn about coding in the

0:00:18.320,0:00:21.760
process this year what we're doing is

0:00:20.640,0:00:24.160
we're doing scratch

0:00:21.760,0:00:26.960
we have two weeks of scratch events this

0:00:24.160,0:00:28.400
first week is kind of for a k-3 focus

0:00:26.960,0:00:30.240
but really it's for anybody that hasn't

0:00:28.400,0:00:31.359
done much coding and what we're going to

0:00:30.240,0:00:32.640
be doing is we're going to be doing

0:00:31.359,0:00:34.079
games

0:00:32.640,0:00:36.480
there's a number of different games that

0:00:34.079,0:00:38.320
we've got lined up they're kind of all a

0:00:36.480,0:00:40.239
little food themed for fun

0:00:38.320,0:00:42.079
it starts with alphabet breakfast that's

0:00:40.239,0:00:43.600
what we're going to be doing today

0:00:42.079,0:00:45.760
then in day two we're gonna be building

0:00:43.600,0:00:48.719
a game called hedgehog snack

0:00:45.760,0:00:50.480
um and then day three is fish lunch fair

0:00:48.719,0:00:51.680
warning day three is the hard one right

0:00:50.480,0:00:52.719
so that's like the middle of the week

0:00:51.680,0:00:55.199
the hardest thing

0:00:52.719,0:00:56.800
um and then catching dinner is four um

0:00:55.199,0:00:57.199
and then we finish on kind of a lighter

0:00:56.800,0:01:00.320
one

0:00:57.199,0:01:01.840
called kaleidoscope dessert and somebody

0:01:00.320,0:01:02.879
different my daughter mckinley is going

0:01:01.840,0:01:05.040
to be leading that one which is going to

0:01:02.879,0:01:06.960
be fun

0:01:05.040,0:01:08.799
this material by the way it was made by

0:01:06.960,0:01:10.880
me i'm at rose-hulman so this

0:01:08.799,0:01:12.960
material is presented by rose-hulman it

0:01:10.880,0:01:14.560
was also developed by bob schaefer

0:01:12.960,0:01:16.479
so he's not on camera here with us but

0:01:14.560,0:01:18.400
he helped develop all the material

0:01:16.479,0:01:19.520
and he's at mission college which is out

0:01:18.400,0:01:20.880
in california

0:01:19.520,0:01:22.720
and so we're partnering this year to

0:01:20.880,0:01:24.240
bring you connecting with code

0:01:22.720,0:01:26.000
and the way this works is in these

0:01:24.240,0:01:28.000
videos i'm not just here by myself

0:01:26.000,0:01:30.079
i'm actually with my family and my

0:01:28.000,0:01:31.360
family is going to serve as my campers

0:01:30.079,0:01:33.119
so i'm going to go and have my family

0:01:31.360,0:01:35.119
introduce themselves me

0:01:33.119,0:01:37.840
i will start with uh with our first

0:01:35.119,0:01:41.439
camper what's your name camper

0:01:37.840,0:01:44.320
neela how old is neela five and i

0:01:41.439,0:01:45.920
go into preschool yeah so neela is five

0:01:44.320,0:01:47.520
and so who's helping neela and she's

0:01:45.920,0:01:50.799
five

0:01:47.520,0:01:52.880
mommy yeah mommy's helping uh who's our

0:01:50.799,0:01:55.520
next camper bowen and how old are you

0:01:52.880,0:01:57.759
and how old are you bowen and so bowen

0:01:55.520,0:01:58.399
seven and so mommy is helping neela a

0:01:57.759,0:02:00.240
lot

0:01:58.399,0:02:01.520
um and she's helping bowen just a little

0:02:00.240,0:02:03.119
less so

0:02:01.520,0:02:05.119
at seven and five they can do it with

0:02:03.119,0:02:06.479
mommy's help then i've got my campers

0:02:05.119,0:02:07.840
who do it all by themselves

0:02:06.479,0:02:09.599
so first camper doing it by yourself

0:02:07.840,0:02:12.239
what's your name um i am

0:02:09.599,0:02:14.480
keegan fisher and how old are you i am

0:02:12.239,0:02:16.480
nine years old and i am instilled good

0:02:14.480,0:02:17.840
so he's nine but he's been coding for a

0:02:16.480,0:02:18.640
while so he's going to be doing it by

0:02:17.840,0:02:21.760
himself and

0:02:18.640,0:02:22.959
our final camper i'm mckinley and i am

0:02:21.760,0:02:25.360
10 years old

0:02:22.959,0:02:26.720
and she is an experienced coder and

0:02:25.360,0:02:29.200
she's definitely doing it

0:02:26.720,0:02:31.440
by herself so that's the campers that i

0:02:29.200,0:02:33.200
have with me here today

0:02:31.440,0:02:35.280
so what are we going to do today so

0:02:33.200,0:02:38.400
today what we're doing is we're building

0:02:35.280,0:02:39.680
a scratch app this whole week is coding

0:02:38.400,0:02:42.959
in scratch

0:02:39.680,0:02:44.480
scratch is a website that you'll go to

0:02:42.959,0:02:46.080
uh to where you build things and learn

0:02:44.480,0:02:47.519
how to code hopefully a lot of people

0:02:46.080,0:02:49.519
have heard about scratch

0:02:47.519,0:02:51.440
let's show a demo of what we're trying

0:02:49.519,0:02:53.360
to make today so today we're making one

0:02:51.440,0:02:55.200
called alphabet breakfast

0:02:53.360,0:02:56.560
so this is the solution so you're just

0:02:55.200,0:02:57.760
kind of watching for a minute and the

0:02:56.560,0:02:59.440
solution

0:02:57.760,0:03:00.959
and the idea of this app let me go and

0:02:59.440,0:03:03.840
make a full screen here

0:03:00.959,0:03:05.519
is that you are avery so avery is

0:03:03.840,0:03:07.120
walking around collecting things

0:03:05.519,0:03:08.879
and she has to collect food in

0:03:07.120,0:03:10.239
alphabetical order wow

0:03:08.879,0:03:12.239
so the first thing she collected there

0:03:10.239,0:03:13.519
was an apple um anybody know what she

0:03:12.239,0:03:16.319
needs to collect next

0:03:13.519,0:03:18.159
what starts with b banana yeah i nearly

0:03:16.319,0:03:19.920
got it so a banana

0:03:18.159,0:03:21.840
um and if i try to eat the wrong thing

0:03:19.920,0:03:25.280
let's say i try to eat an egg next does

0:03:21.840,0:03:26.720
e egg start with c not really so it just

0:03:25.280,0:03:28.319
says keep trying food should be eaten

0:03:26.720,0:03:29.280
alphabetically so i got to find a

0:03:28.319,0:03:32.640
c food anybody

0:03:29.280,0:03:34.640
see a good c food okay cake

0:03:32.640,0:03:36.959
and so we eat cake what comes after cake

0:03:34.640,0:03:41.280
you think

0:03:36.959,0:03:43.840
donut donut uh after donut

0:03:41.280,0:03:43.840
egg

0:03:44.400,0:03:50.000
and then she does a little dance so

0:03:47.440,0:03:52.480
that's what we're building today it's a

0:03:50.000,0:03:53.599
long song i guess

0:03:52.480,0:03:55.120
that's what we're building today and

0:03:53.599,0:03:56.000
that's our goal and we're going to be

0:03:55.120,0:03:58.239
building it up

0:03:56.000,0:04:00.400
uh with a block based programming

0:03:58.239,0:04:02.239
language called scratch

0:04:00.400,0:04:03.519
and we're going to be learning a lot of

0:04:02.239,0:04:05.040
great things today these are kind of

0:04:03.519,0:04:05.599
like our learning objectives maybe i'll

0:04:05.040,0:04:07.760
come

0:04:05.599,0:04:09.120
reflect on these at the end what you

0:04:07.760,0:04:11.599
need to do is you need to go to this

0:04:09.120,0:04:11.599
website

0:04:12.360,0:04:16.160
scratch.mit.edu

0:04:13.599,0:04:17.519
you can see scratch was first made when

0:04:16.160,0:04:20.320
it was at mit

0:04:17.519,0:04:22.079
and it's grown so much since then when

0:04:20.320,0:04:22.560
you're on this scratch page your first

0:04:22.079,0:04:24.960
choice

0:04:22.560,0:04:26.560
is you can either just get started which

0:04:24.960,0:04:27.440
is great you'll just click on create if

0:04:26.560,0:04:29.840
you want

0:04:27.440,0:04:31.520
or if you like you can sign in it

0:04:29.840,0:04:32.080
doesn't matter to me if you sign in or

0:04:31.520,0:04:33.840
not

0:04:32.080,0:04:35.360
i'm in general i think that you should

0:04:33.840,0:04:37.280
because your work will will be saved

0:04:35.360,0:04:39.280
more permanently to your account

0:04:37.280,0:04:40.960
but it's pretty easy to sign up and if

0:04:39.280,0:04:41.840
you want to do that you can just pause

0:04:40.960,0:04:44.000
the video

0:04:41.840,0:04:45.520
and go do that on your own so campers

0:04:44.000,0:04:47.440
are you ready to get started

0:04:45.520,0:04:48.960
yes yes all right everybody click on

0:04:47.440,0:04:51.360
create

0:04:48.960,0:04:52.160
when you click on create it makes a new

0:04:51.360,0:04:54.479
program

0:04:52.160,0:04:57.120
um whenever you have a new program uh

0:04:54.479,0:04:59.440
you get to see the editor here

0:04:57.120,0:05:00.800
uh the editor is broken into a lot of

0:04:59.440,0:05:02.240
different places

0:05:00.800,0:05:04.240
let's just talk about it some so we're

0:05:02.240,0:05:05.919
more familiar with scratch

0:05:04.240,0:05:08.080
this area right over here this upper

0:05:05.919,0:05:11.120
right is called the stage

0:05:08.080,0:05:12.479
below the stage are the different actors

0:05:11.120,0:05:15.280
that are like on the stage

0:05:12.479,0:05:16.960
um sprites ah shoot i gave it away

0:05:15.280,0:05:19.120
scratch calls them the special name does

0:05:16.960,0:05:21.360
anybody know what the special name is

0:05:19.120,0:05:23.520
sprite i gave away the answer so they're

0:05:21.360,0:05:24.720
called sprites we have one sprite right

0:05:23.520,0:05:27.840
now

0:05:24.720,0:05:30.960
but we can actually have many sprites

0:05:27.840,0:05:32.400
sprites have code so each sprite has

0:05:30.960,0:05:34.560
their own code

0:05:32.400,0:05:36.400
the code is over here in the left in the

0:05:34.560,0:05:41.360
toolbar let's drag over

0:05:36.400,0:05:44.639
one line of code so drag over move 10

0:05:41.360,0:05:45.360
so now you can see that our cat has code

0:05:44.639,0:05:48.080
that he can run

0:05:45.360,0:05:49.199
move10 so the question is how do we run

0:05:48.080,0:05:50.800
this code

0:05:49.199,0:05:52.240
well one way to run it is to double

0:05:50.800,0:05:53.520
click on it so double click on where it

0:05:52.240,0:05:54.960
says move 10

0:05:53.520,0:05:57.680
and you'll notice something about your

0:05:54.960,0:06:01.120
mouse every time you double click it

0:05:57.680,0:06:02.720
he'll go over to the right now one fun

0:06:01.120,0:06:03.919
thing is you can also just kind of drag

0:06:02.720,0:06:06.000
them back over here

0:06:03.919,0:06:07.199
and you can double click it and you can

0:06:06.000,0:06:08.800
run it some more

0:06:07.199,0:06:11.039
eventually you'll get bored with doing

0:06:08.800,0:06:14.160
this so once you're bored with this

0:06:11.039,0:06:16.479
let's let's do some more things now

0:06:14.160,0:06:17.199
double clicking on it is one way to run

0:06:16.479,0:06:19.840
code

0:06:17.199,0:06:20.400
but a much better way to run code is to

0:06:19.840,0:06:23.919
add

0:06:20.400,0:06:25.919
a when green flag clicked so let's

0:06:23.919,0:06:28.319
look at these uh commands if you scroll

0:06:25.919,0:06:31.120
down through here there's some blue ones

0:06:28.319,0:06:33.039
uh and then there's some purple ones and

0:06:31.120,0:06:34.400
then there's some yellow ones and maybe

0:06:33.039,0:06:36.720
you call that orange

0:06:34.400,0:06:38.080
and there's a lot of commands to make it

0:06:36.720,0:06:39.759
easier to get around the commands

0:06:38.080,0:06:42.720
they're broken into categories

0:06:39.759,0:06:43.759
um the category we want is events so

0:06:42.720,0:06:45.360
click on

0:06:43.759,0:06:48.000
over here on the far left where it says

0:06:45.360,0:06:50.000
events and it'll scroll you to that

0:06:48.000,0:06:51.680
section of the code so you can kind of

0:06:50.000,0:06:53.120
see that these things they just help you

0:06:51.680,0:06:55.440
scroll around

0:06:53.120,0:06:56.560
to find the right category so the most

0:06:55.440,0:07:00.840
common way to run

0:06:56.560,0:07:03.680
code is to grab this when green flag

0:07:00.840,0:07:06.479
clicked and put it and just snap it

0:07:03.680,0:07:08.560
right on top of your code

0:07:06.479,0:07:10.560
so this is what most scratch programs

0:07:08.560,0:07:11.919
look like so this is considered like the

0:07:10.560,0:07:14.479
start of the program

0:07:11.919,0:07:15.039
so our cat when the green flag is

0:07:14.479,0:07:16.960
clicked

0:07:15.039,0:07:19.120
he's going to move 10. let's try it a

0:07:16.960,0:07:22.319
couple times so click on

0:07:19.120,0:07:25.199
the green flag and he'll move he'll move

0:07:22.319,0:07:25.199
across the stage

0:07:25.919,0:07:29.120
so this is just to kind of get you

0:07:27.280,0:07:31.759
familiar with the environment

0:07:29.120,0:07:33.680
that we're working in but actually we we

0:07:31.759,0:07:35.360
don't need a cat at all in this game if

0:07:33.680,0:07:37.599
you remember looking at the solution

0:07:35.360,0:07:39.360
there are no cats in there so we don't

0:07:37.599,0:07:40.960
need this particular sprite

0:07:39.360,0:07:43.280
so what i want to do is i want to delete

0:07:40.960,0:07:45.360
this sprite so he was just a test

0:07:43.280,0:07:46.560
to delete it some of my campers found

0:07:45.360,0:07:48.879
this already

0:07:46.560,0:07:51.440
there's a trash can i got over here and

0:07:48.879,0:07:54.400
if you click this trash can icon

0:07:51.440,0:07:56.560
the cat will be gone poof if you ever do

0:07:54.400,0:07:58.160
something like that on accident

0:07:56.560,0:08:00.720
campers how do you how do you fix a

0:07:58.160,0:08:03.199
problem if you did that on accident

0:08:00.720,0:08:04.479
yeah command z or control z depending on

0:08:03.199,0:08:06.160
what type of computer you're on uh

0:08:04.479,0:08:10.479
that's undo so if i messed up

0:08:06.160,0:08:12.560
i just hit um uh control z or command z

0:08:10.479,0:08:14.319
uh oops that didn't work you can also go

0:08:12.560,0:08:15.199
to edit uh restore sprite and it'll just

0:08:14.319,0:08:16.400
be back right

0:08:15.199,0:08:19.199
i did want to delete them that was a

0:08:16.400,0:08:21.120
good thing to do but just know that undo

0:08:19.199,0:08:22.319
is very important with things you're

0:08:21.120,0:08:25.360
doing

0:08:22.319,0:08:27.520
all right now let's add a new sprite

0:08:25.360,0:08:28.560
i've got a sprite that i'm planning on

0:08:27.520,0:08:31.440
you're using

0:08:28.560,0:08:32.479
her name is avery walking so what we

0:08:31.440,0:08:35.440
want to do

0:08:32.479,0:08:36.240
is we want to add a new sprite to do

0:08:35.440,0:08:38.839
that

0:08:36.240,0:08:40.080
there's a circle down here for choose a

0:08:38.839,0:08:41.680
sprite

0:08:40.080,0:08:43.039
this circle confuses me a little bit

0:08:41.680,0:08:45.600
because what happens is when i hover

0:08:43.039,0:08:47.279
over it it like shoots up this thing

0:08:45.600,0:08:48.720
it turns out you can ignore the thing

0:08:47.279,0:08:49.440
that pops up you can just click right on

0:08:48.720,0:08:51.200
the circle

0:08:49.440,0:08:52.160
so click right on the circle and what

0:08:51.200,0:08:53.680
we're going to do is we're going to add

0:08:52.160,0:08:56.240
a different sprites

0:08:53.680,0:08:58.320
instead of that cat and i'm looking for

0:08:56.240,0:09:00.160
one called avery walking

0:08:58.320,0:09:01.920
now i can see avery walking is right

0:09:00.160,0:09:03.760
here so i'm just going to select it

0:09:01.920,0:09:05.440
but just know that when you're looking

0:09:03.760,0:09:06.000
for sprites you can search for them in

0:09:05.440,0:09:08.160
here

0:09:06.000,0:09:09.279
you can also organize them by category

0:09:08.160,0:09:12.160
lots of options

0:09:09.279,0:09:13.279
but i want avery walking so when i click

0:09:12.160,0:09:17.680
on her

0:09:13.279,0:09:21.040
she's now into my scratch project

0:09:17.680,0:09:23.440
avery um is uh looking pretty good

0:09:21.040,0:09:24.880
she's a little big so what i want to do

0:09:23.440,0:09:28.399
is i want to make her

0:09:24.880,0:09:29.600
a little smaller so right here is the

0:09:28.399,0:09:31.760
size

0:09:29.600,0:09:33.519
the size right now is set to 100 that

0:09:31.760,0:09:36.399
means 100 percent

0:09:33.519,0:09:37.200
of her normal size make her some amount

0:09:36.399,0:09:40.720
smaller

0:09:37.200,0:09:41.760
i'm going to go with 60. so now she'll

0:09:40.720,0:09:44.959
be able to

0:09:41.760,0:09:47.279
play this game better

0:09:44.959,0:09:49.120
right next to size you can see she's

0:09:47.279,0:09:49.760
also got what direction she's pointing

0:09:49.120,0:09:52.240
in

0:09:49.760,0:09:54.720
and you can kind of like move her around

0:09:52.240,0:09:54.720
like this

0:09:54.800,0:09:58.560
which is kind of fun and after a while

0:09:56.399,0:09:59.920
you'll get dizzy now sprites have

0:09:58.560,0:10:01.600
different modes

0:09:59.920,0:10:04.079
you can see that right now her mode is

0:10:01.600,0:10:06.000
that she can point in any direction

0:10:04.079,0:10:07.600
i think she looks silly when she's like

0:10:06.000,0:10:10.160
walking up

0:10:07.600,0:10:12.000
and so what i do is i switch her mode

0:10:10.160,0:10:14.640
right now the mode is set to any

0:10:12.000,0:10:16.320
directions called all around you can

0:10:14.640,0:10:17.120
also switch it to where she's just left

0:10:16.320,0:10:19.200
right

0:10:17.120,0:10:20.800
or where she doesn't rotate at all i

0:10:19.200,0:10:23.600
want to switch her mode

0:10:20.800,0:10:24.640
to where she just does left right so i

0:10:23.600,0:10:26.399
fixed her size

0:10:24.640,0:10:27.680
so she's the right size and then i

0:10:26.399,0:10:29.760
switched her mode

0:10:27.680,0:10:31.200
to where she's just left right and so

0:10:29.760,0:10:33.279
now if she's pointing

0:10:31.200,0:10:35.040
anywhere to the left her sprite just

0:10:33.279,0:10:37.040
kind of looks like it's straight left

0:10:35.040,0:10:38.800
and if she's anywhere to the right she's

0:10:37.040,0:10:41.600
straight right so she's only got those

0:10:38.800,0:10:42.720
two options now it doesn't really matter

0:10:41.600,0:10:47.680
where you leave this arrow but i'm going

0:10:42.720,0:10:50.480
to put mine back to roughly 90 degrees

0:10:47.680,0:10:52.320
all right so avery is ready to go but

0:10:50.480,0:10:53.920
she has no code

0:10:52.320,0:10:55.519
the first thing we're going to do is

0:10:53.920,0:10:57.360
we're going to add a when green flag

0:10:55.519,0:10:59.360
clicked

0:10:57.360,0:11:01.839
so i'm still in my events area so i can

0:10:59.360,0:11:01.839
just bring it over

0:11:02.000,0:11:05.040
and what we want avery to do is we want

0:11:04.160,0:11:09.200
her for to

0:11:05.040,0:11:11.760
forever move and follow the mouse

0:11:09.200,0:11:13.519
so it's really mean to tell people to do

0:11:11.760,0:11:14.480
something forever but in code it happens

0:11:13.519,0:11:16.480
all the time

0:11:14.480,0:11:18.000
so let's see if we can find uh the

0:11:16.480,0:11:19.600
forever statement

0:11:18.000,0:11:21.279
so the forever statement is in the

0:11:19.600,0:11:23.600
control category

0:11:21.279,0:11:25.440
control is just below events so you can

0:11:23.600,0:11:28.399
just scroll down there if you want

0:11:25.440,0:11:29.600
or you can click on this word control

0:11:28.399,0:11:32.000
and what you're doing is you're trying

0:11:29.600,0:11:33.600
to find a forever loop

0:11:32.000,0:11:35.440
so the forever loop it's the third one

0:11:33.600,0:11:36.160
down right here so just drag a forever

0:11:35.440,0:11:39.279
loop

0:11:36.160,0:11:41.040
and pop it into place so now when the

0:11:39.279,0:11:43.839
green flag is clicked

0:11:41.040,0:11:45.680
avery is going to do something forever

0:11:43.839,0:11:47.519
and right now the thing she does forever

0:11:45.680,0:11:49.200
is is nothing there's no code in there

0:11:47.519,0:11:51.120
let's add some code in there

0:11:49.200,0:11:55.040
the code we're going to add is up in

0:11:51.120,0:11:55.040
motion so go on motion

0:11:55.360,0:12:00.240
um and find one that says point towards

0:11:58.800,0:12:01.680
mouse pointer

0:12:00.240,0:12:03.519
now this one's tricky because there's a

0:12:01.680,0:12:08.079
couple in here that are somewhere

0:12:03.519,0:12:08.079
but i want point towards mouse pointer

0:12:09.279,0:12:13.839
some people accidentally grab like go to

0:12:12.399,0:12:15.920
or something like that but point towards

0:12:13.839,0:12:17.920
will do it so if we're pointing towards

0:12:15.920,0:12:20.560
the mouse pointer

0:12:17.920,0:12:22.000
um when i run this program she should

0:12:20.560,0:12:23.440
point towards my mouse pointer now she

0:12:22.000,0:12:25.279
only points left or right

0:12:23.440,0:12:27.279
so when i run it and my mouse is over

0:12:25.279,0:12:29.120
here she points over here

0:12:27.279,0:12:30.399
and if my mouse goes on the other side

0:12:29.120,0:12:32.399
she switches direction

0:12:30.399,0:12:33.839
so she's pointing to the left she's

0:12:32.399,0:12:37.120
pointing towards the right

0:12:33.839,0:12:38.720
left right left right left right

0:12:37.120,0:12:40.399
you can also see that the code is

0:12:38.720,0:12:41.839
running in a couple of other ways first

0:12:40.399,0:12:43.040
it's outlined in yellow

0:12:41.839,0:12:45.120
so you can see that it's running because

0:12:43.040,0:12:46.560
it's outlined in yellow also the green

0:12:45.120,0:12:48.800
flag kind of appears that it's like

0:12:46.560,0:12:51.760
continually depressed

0:12:48.800,0:12:53.360
it's not sad it's just always pressed

0:12:51.760,0:12:55.200
all right

0:12:53.360,0:12:56.959
let's add some more code my campers

0:12:55.200,0:12:59.440
doing okay

0:12:56.959,0:13:00.399
everybody good all right let's do some

0:12:59.440,0:13:03.680
movement

0:13:00.399,0:13:04.320
so just below that point towards add a

0:13:03.680,0:13:07.839
move

0:13:04.320,0:13:07.839
10 steps

0:13:08.560,0:13:12.399
and the value 10 determines how fast she

0:13:11.360,0:13:14.160
walks

0:13:12.399,0:13:17.360
so right now i'm going to go ahead and

0:13:14.160,0:13:21.839
run it and she's going to move towards

0:13:17.360,0:13:21.839
my mouse at 10.

0:13:22.079,0:13:26.079
if you want to play with speeds um every

0:13:24.399,0:13:28.959
every kid likes to do this right so you

0:13:26.079,0:13:30.720
can you can go faster

0:13:28.959,0:13:32.560
but if she goes too fast it works out

0:13:30.720,0:13:34.639
badly right so everybody likes to do

0:13:32.560,0:13:37.519
that so i just showing it to you

0:13:34.639,0:13:40.720
you can go slower so if i go at two

0:13:37.519,0:13:40.720
she'll just go really slow

0:13:45.040,0:13:49.279
and i'm going to leave mine at 15 is

0:13:47.600,0:13:51.519
where i'm going to leave mine

0:13:49.279,0:13:54.720
that will appear to be kind of fast but

0:13:51.519,0:13:54.720
we're going to fix that in a minute

0:13:55.120,0:13:59.839
so you can play around with it but i'm

0:13:58.240,0:14:00.880
going to leave mine at 15 because i'm

0:13:59.839,0:14:02.079
going to do something

0:14:00.880,0:14:03.760
here in a minute that's gonna make that

0:14:02.079,0:14:06.320
be the correct speed right now it's a

0:14:03.760,0:14:06.320
little fast

0:14:08.079,0:14:14.160
another problem that i have is avery

0:14:11.519,0:14:15.360
is gliding places right i want her to be

0:14:14.160,0:14:16.399
walking places

0:14:15.360,0:14:19.040
now i'm going to show you something

0:14:16.399,0:14:20.480
about avery avery has code we can see

0:14:19.040,0:14:21.440
her code here because we're in the code

0:14:20.480,0:14:24.639
tab

0:14:21.440,0:14:26.560
avery also has costumes and avery has

0:14:24.639,0:14:29.519
sounds

0:14:26.560,0:14:31.760
what we the reason we picked avery is

0:14:29.519,0:14:34.079
because she has four costumes

0:14:31.760,0:14:35.920
and if you cycle between those costumes

0:14:34.079,0:14:38.880
it'll look like she's walking

0:14:35.920,0:14:41.199
so if you picked avery then you can make

0:14:38.880,0:14:43.839
her look like she's walking

0:14:41.199,0:14:44.800
so let's let's do that let's go into

0:14:43.839,0:14:46.560
looks

0:14:44.800,0:14:48.000
because her costume like the way she

0:14:46.560,0:14:51.199
looks is in looks

0:14:48.000,0:14:54.240
and find this one called next costume

0:14:51.199,0:14:54.240
and put it on the bottom

0:14:54.480,0:14:57.519
now i'm going to warn you she's going to

0:14:55.839,0:14:59.440
walk really fast

0:14:57.519,0:15:02.160
so you can see that she walks quite

0:14:59.440,0:15:04.320
quickly as she's going around

0:15:02.160,0:15:05.199
and it's kind of comical to watch her

0:15:04.320,0:15:07.839
but it is a little

0:15:05.199,0:15:07.839
too fast

0:15:08.720,0:15:14.000
so how do we slow her down um so the way

0:15:12.560,0:15:16.720
i want to slow her down

0:15:14.000,0:15:18.639
is i want to put in a short time delay

0:15:16.720,0:15:20.959
and so with a short time delay

0:15:18.639,0:15:22.959
it'll make her look like she's walking

0:15:20.959,0:15:25.279
not extremely fast

0:15:22.959,0:15:27.839
time delays are over in control so go to

0:15:25.279,0:15:27.839
control

0:15:28.560,0:15:33.279
take a wait one second

0:15:31.600,0:15:35.040
and put it down at the bottom of your

0:15:33.279,0:15:36.079
function the bottom of your favorite

0:15:35.040,0:15:38.079
loop so now

0:15:36.079,0:15:39.600
we're pointing towards the mouse pointer

0:15:38.079,0:15:41.199
we're moving 10

0:15:39.600,0:15:43.519
we're switching costumes so she looks

0:15:41.199,0:15:46.160
like walks um and then we're waiting

0:15:43.519,0:15:49.360
one second you can try one second but

0:15:46.160,0:15:49.360
it's going to be way too slow

0:15:50.079,0:15:55.320
that's quite painful and so i'm going to

0:15:53.360,0:15:58.880
switch it to

0:15:55.320,0:15:58.880
0.1 seconds

0:16:00.480,0:16:04.560
that i think looks good enough for me

0:16:05.040,0:16:10.560
so she's walking around and it looks

0:16:08.079,0:16:11.759
like things are going well

0:16:10.560,0:16:13.440
i think i'm going to come around i'm

0:16:11.759,0:16:14.959
going to check on some of my campers to

0:16:13.440,0:16:16.240
see how they're doing

0:16:14.959,0:16:18.720
and it'll give you a minute to get

0:16:16.240,0:16:21.360
caught up if you're falling behind

0:16:18.720,0:16:22.720
all right neela let's start with you so

0:16:21.360,0:16:24.639
have you got yours caught up

0:16:22.720,0:16:26.160
oh neil is a little on the independent

0:16:24.639,0:16:28.000
side neela

0:16:26.160,0:16:29.199
put a big old horse in there instead of

0:16:28.000,0:16:31.279
avery walking

0:16:29.199,0:16:32.959
um it looks really good can you show

0:16:31.279,0:16:35.199
that he moves around so you do

0:16:32.959,0:16:37.759
the green flag there and then as you

0:16:35.199,0:16:41.279
move the mouse around it's going great

0:16:37.759,0:16:43.440
bowen oh what a bunch of rule followers

0:16:41.279,0:16:45.279
bowen's got a penguin on here hit it

0:16:43.440,0:16:47.199
bowen let's see yours oh and the penguin

0:16:45.279,0:16:50.639
oh that's kind of neat bowen the penguin

0:16:47.199,0:16:51.199
has a walking animation great job you

0:16:50.639,0:16:52.959
two

0:16:51.199,0:16:55.120
five and seven you can do it let's check

0:16:52.959,0:16:57.759
on our our older campers

0:16:55.120,0:16:59.040
um so we've got mckinley uh with an

0:16:57.759,0:17:02.320
avery

0:16:59.040,0:17:05.919
yours is a little fast change it to 0.1

0:17:02.320,0:17:06.959
instead of zero one um and keegan's is

0:17:05.919,0:17:08.640
right there

0:17:06.959,0:17:10.640
mckinley says she knew what she was

0:17:08.640,0:17:11.360
supposed to do she just wanted it to be

0:17:10.640,0:17:14.160
fast

0:17:11.360,0:17:15.360
i suppose that's okay all right so the

0:17:14.160,0:17:18.240
next thing we want to do

0:17:15.360,0:17:19.280
is avery's looking good avery's walking

0:17:18.240,0:17:21.439
around a white

0:17:19.280,0:17:22.799
space let's go ahead and give her a

0:17:21.439,0:17:25.199
better background

0:17:22.799,0:17:25.839
so just like we added a sprite we're

0:17:25.199,0:17:28.319
going to add

0:17:25.839,0:17:29.679
a backdrop so in the lower right corner

0:17:28.319,0:17:30.320
here there's a circle that says choose

0:17:29.679,0:17:31.919
backdrop

0:17:30.320,0:17:34.400
go ahead and click on that circle in the

0:17:31.919,0:17:36.320
lower right corner

0:17:34.400,0:17:37.840
just like with sprites it will take you

0:17:36.320,0:17:39.440
to a screen that lets you pick the one

0:17:37.840,0:17:42.160
you want

0:17:39.440,0:17:43.600
what i chose to do is i chose to do

0:17:42.160,0:17:45.600
bedroom one

0:17:43.600,0:17:47.760
because i thought that it would be good

0:17:45.600,0:17:48.799
to be able to hide things in there

0:17:47.760,0:17:51.120
and to kind of make it look like it's

0:17:48.799,0:17:52.400
part of the environment i don't mind if

0:17:51.120,0:17:55.200
you do something different

0:17:52.400,0:17:57.360
you can do whatever you want to do but

0:17:55.200,0:17:58.559
just pick one that you think you'd like

0:17:57.360,0:18:01.360
while you're picking that i'm going to

0:17:58.559,0:18:02.400
talk about backdrops just a little bit

0:18:01.360,0:18:04.480
the first thing i want to say about

0:18:02.400,0:18:06.320
backdrops is that you can see right now

0:18:04.480,0:18:07.120
that my sprite is selected and i can see

0:18:06.320,0:18:08.720
her code

0:18:07.120,0:18:11.760
if i ever accidentally click on the

0:18:08.720,0:18:13.200
stage now it shows my stages code so do

0:18:11.760,0:18:14.000
this for me go back and forth click on

0:18:13.200,0:18:15.360
your sprite

0:18:14.000,0:18:17.200
and you can see your sprites code is

0:18:15.360,0:18:19.679
here and then if you click on your

0:18:17.200,0:18:21.520
backdrop which is over here to the right

0:18:19.679,0:18:23.679
you can see the backdrops code which is

0:18:21.520,0:18:24.480
blank i only point that out because

0:18:23.679,0:18:25.840
sometimes people

0:18:24.480,0:18:27.919
accidentally click over there and

0:18:25.840,0:18:31.039
they're like where'd all my code go

0:18:27.919,0:18:33.039
and it's because code can be different

0:18:31.039,0:18:34.400
for different sprites it can also be

0:18:33.039,0:18:35.919
different for the backdrop

0:18:34.400,0:18:38.559
and just know to bring your code back

0:18:35.919,0:18:41.919
all you have to do is click on avery

0:18:38.559,0:18:42.720
easy peasy all right let's add a new

0:18:41.919,0:18:44.880
sprite

0:18:42.720,0:18:46.400
so we want to add food for her to eat

0:18:44.880,0:18:48.000
alphabetically

0:18:46.400,0:18:49.760
and so this time i think it really would

0:18:48.000,0:18:51.200
be best if you follow along and you add

0:18:49.760,0:18:53.919
an apple

0:18:51.200,0:18:55.600
so click on choose sprite the circle

0:18:53.919,0:18:59.039
down here

0:18:55.600,0:19:00.640
and see if you can find an apple

0:18:59.039,0:19:03.039
now you can see that there's two

0:19:00.640,0:19:05.600
different sprites there's avery

0:19:03.039,0:19:06.720
and avery has code that we've written

0:19:05.600,0:19:09.200
and then there's an apple

0:19:06.720,0:19:10.720
which currently has no code at all and

0:19:09.200,0:19:12.080
you can go back and forth between them

0:19:10.720,0:19:14.000
pretty easily

0:19:12.080,0:19:15.919
the apple if you like its size you can

0:19:14.000,0:19:17.919
leave it i'm going to choose to make my

0:19:15.919,0:19:21.280
apple just a little bit smaller

0:19:17.919,0:19:23.679
maybe a 70 apple you can also put it

0:19:21.280,0:19:25.520
somewhere in your environment

0:19:23.679,0:19:27.120
maybe i'll do a 50 apple and put it on

0:19:25.520,0:19:28.720
the table to where it kind of looks like

0:19:27.120,0:19:29.840
it belongs so it's a little bit more

0:19:28.720,0:19:33.600
hidden

0:19:29.840,0:19:35.360
that's optional next let's write some

0:19:33.600,0:19:36.799
code for the apple

0:19:35.360,0:19:38.720
oh i just realized there's another

0:19:36.799,0:19:40.720
important thing that i forgot to do

0:19:38.720,0:19:42.240
uh whenever you're coding ask my campers

0:19:40.720,0:19:44.240
this what's an important thing to do

0:19:42.240,0:19:45.679
when you're coding campers

0:19:44.240,0:19:47.280
save it's important to save every so

0:19:45.679,0:19:49.039
often what i'm going to do is i'm going

0:19:47.280,0:19:51.280
to name my project

0:19:49.039,0:19:52.320
i'm going to name mine alphabet

0:19:51.280,0:19:54.000
breakfast

0:19:52.320,0:19:55.919
you can name your project anything you'd

0:19:54.000,0:19:58.000
like and it does

0:19:55.919,0:20:00.000
auto save but if you ever want to force

0:19:58.000,0:20:02.960
it to save you can click on file

0:20:00.000,0:20:04.480
save now so it will periodically auto

0:20:02.960,0:20:05.679
save so you don't have to keep hitting

0:20:04.480,0:20:06.880
file save now

0:20:05.679,0:20:08.400
but if you ever do something you're like

0:20:06.880,0:20:09.840
oh i want to make sure it's saved just

0:20:08.400,0:20:12.480
click on file save now

0:20:09.840,0:20:13.200
and you'll be sure that it saves back to

0:20:12.480,0:20:16.720
the apple

0:20:13.200,0:20:18.960
so the apple uh let's go ahead and do a

0:20:16.720,0:20:21.840
when green flag for for him as well so

0:20:18.960,0:20:21.840
click on events

0:20:22.640,0:20:26.799
when green flag clicked you'll find that

0:20:25.200,0:20:28.080
a lot of sprites start that way unless

0:20:26.799,0:20:30.400
you're doing something really advanced a

0:20:28.080,0:20:31.520
lot of them start this way

0:20:30.400,0:20:33.360
and what we're going to do with the

0:20:31.520,0:20:35.039
apple is we're going to decide to show

0:20:33.360,0:20:36.480
him or hide him so he's going to either

0:20:35.039,0:20:39.200
be shown or hidden

0:20:36.480,0:20:40.720
so the first thing i'm going to do is

0:20:39.200,0:20:43.039
i'm going to make sure he's shown

0:20:40.720,0:20:45.280
at when the program starts so go to

0:20:43.039,0:20:49.280
looks first

0:20:45.280,0:20:50.799
and find show now i know right now he's

0:20:49.280,0:20:52.480
shown and everything's fine

0:20:50.799,0:20:54.000
but periodically in this app he's going

0:20:52.480,0:20:55.039
to get hidden and i want to make sure he

0:20:54.000,0:20:57.760
starts off

0:20:55.039,0:20:57.760
being shown

0:20:58.159,0:21:03.039
now the next thing we want to do is we

0:20:59.760,0:21:04.559
want to forever check to see if avery's

0:21:03.039,0:21:06.000
touching the apple

0:21:04.559,0:21:08.240
so what i'm going to do next is i'm

0:21:06.000,0:21:11.280
going to add a forever loop

0:21:08.240,0:21:11.280
so i'm in control

0:21:11.679,0:21:14.799
and i drag a forever loop over

0:21:13.440,0:21:17.360
[Music]

0:21:14.799,0:21:18.320
all right now inside the forever loop we

0:21:17.360,0:21:21.440
want to check

0:21:18.320,0:21:23.280
if she's touching the apple uh this is

0:21:21.440,0:21:25.440
one of our our flow control statements

0:21:23.280,0:21:27.360
it's also uh in the control area

0:21:25.440,0:21:28.880
and it looks like this it's just an if

0:21:27.360,0:21:32.000
so drag this if over

0:21:28.880,0:21:33.679
and drop it inside the forever loop so

0:21:32.000,0:21:36.880
we're forever going to check

0:21:33.679,0:21:38.159
if something is happening now the way

0:21:36.880,0:21:40.480
you read this is it says

0:21:38.159,0:21:43.600
if and then this diamond shape is the

0:21:40.480,0:21:47.280
condition so if this condition is true

0:21:43.600,0:21:48.799
then run this code now let's find a good

0:21:47.280,0:21:52.480
condition to put in here

0:21:48.799,0:21:55.600
go into sensing so we want to sense

0:21:52.480,0:21:57.440
if we're touching avery or not

0:21:55.600,0:21:59.280
so this is kind of interesting but the

0:21:57.440,0:22:03.280
thing we want to drag into there

0:21:59.280,0:22:04.880
is actually if touching mouse pointer

0:22:03.280,0:22:08.320
and the reason we're going to drag this

0:22:04.880,0:22:10.720
in is you see this white arrow on here

0:22:08.320,0:22:12.240
so this white arrow means that you can

0:22:10.720,0:22:14.720
probably change it um

0:22:12.240,0:22:16.480
and sure enough you can change it to say

0:22:14.720,0:22:19.440
um if touching

0:22:16.480,0:22:22.559
avery walking so every walking is the

0:22:19.440,0:22:26.880
name of that other sprite

0:22:22.559,0:22:30.559
so um if touching avery walking

0:22:26.880,0:22:32.000
then we want to hide

0:22:30.559,0:22:34.320
hide is a command which is over and

0:22:32.000,0:22:34.320
looks

0:22:35.280,0:22:41.280
so we're going to bring in a hide and

0:22:37.120,0:22:43.039
drop it right there

0:22:41.280,0:22:45.679
so you can see that the apple has code

0:22:43.039,0:22:46.880
that it runs and avery has code that she

0:22:45.679,0:22:50.080
runs

0:22:46.880,0:22:53.039
and if i hit the green flag right now

0:22:50.080,0:22:55.120
avery's gonna walk around and as soon as

0:22:53.039,0:22:58.880
she touches the apple

0:22:55.120,0:23:01.600
it disappears it's gone

0:22:58.880,0:23:05.280
and then if you stop your program and

0:23:01.600,0:23:05.280
restart it the apple comes back

0:23:06.080,0:23:11.440
cool i'd say it's going pretty well

0:23:09.120,0:23:12.480
um another important thing with games is

0:23:11.440,0:23:15.120
that they're fun

0:23:12.480,0:23:16.480
right so right now the apple just just

0:23:15.120,0:23:18.320
disappears

0:23:16.480,0:23:20.000
i think it'd be more fun if our apple

0:23:18.320,0:23:22.640
made a little bit of noise

0:23:20.000,0:23:24.240
so our apple is gonna make a noise uh

0:23:22.640,0:23:27.039
whenever we get it we're gonna make a

0:23:24.240,0:23:27.039
chomp sound

0:23:27.120,0:23:31.600
all sprites have sounds that they

0:23:30.240,0:23:33.520
currently know about

0:23:31.600,0:23:36.400
let's click on the apple and let's see

0:23:33.520,0:23:37.440
what sounds it knows about sure enough

0:23:36.400,0:23:40.720
he has a sound called

0:23:37.440,0:23:41.760
chomp uh go ahead and play it it kind of

0:23:40.720,0:23:45.760
sounds like oh

0:23:41.760,0:23:47.360
on the apple so he already has the sound

0:23:45.760,0:23:48.720
we want if we wanted more sounds we

0:23:47.360,0:23:50.159
could add him but we don't need to for

0:23:48.720,0:23:52.400
him he's got the sound we want so let's

0:23:50.159,0:23:54.720
go back to our code

0:23:52.400,0:23:56.400
so in the code look for sound

0:23:54.720,0:23:59.440
[Music]

0:23:56.400,0:24:04.480
and what we want to do is we want to

0:23:59.440,0:24:06.159
play sound chomp

0:24:04.480,0:24:07.919
now there's a couple versions of this

0:24:06.159,0:24:09.919
there's play sound until done

0:24:07.919,0:24:11.520
and then there's start sound chomp in

0:24:09.919,0:24:13.440
this case it doesn't matter you can put

0:24:11.520,0:24:16.400
in either one that you'd want

0:24:13.440,0:24:18.480
um so let's go ahead and run it again

0:24:16.400,0:24:20.559
and now when we hit the apple

0:24:18.480,0:24:22.640
it should make a home chomp sound which

0:24:20.559,0:24:23.840
is kind of fun

0:24:22.640,0:24:25.679
i don't know if you can hear the chomp

0:24:23.840,0:24:26.720
on the video as well but mine worked

0:24:25.679,0:24:28.240
really nicely

0:24:26.720,0:24:31.200
all right the next thing we're going to

0:24:28.240,0:24:34.000
do is we're going to add a variable

0:24:31.200,0:24:35.840
so if you remember the main game what it

0:24:34.000,0:24:37.520
did is it had many

0:24:35.840,0:24:39.760
many different things you had to eat

0:24:37.520,0:24:41.200
right and we had to know

0:24:39.760,0:24:42.400
was it time to eat the apple or not

0:24:41.200,0:24:42.960
because we tried to eat the bananas

0:24:42.400,0:24:45.360
first

0:24:42.960,0:24:46.320
it would say keep trying food should be

0:24:45.360,0:24:48.640
alphabetically

0:24:46.320,0:24:50.080
but if you eat the apple first then it

0:24:48.640,0:24:52.799
should work right

0:24:50.080,0:24:54.799
and so what we need to do is we need to

0:24:52.799,0:24:57.679
keep track of the state of the game

0:24:54.799,0:25:01.840
the state of the game is a variable so

0:24:57.679,0:25:01.840
do this click on variables for me

0:25:03.200,0:25:07.520
and click on make a variable

0:25:08.400,0:25:13.600
i'm going to name this variable food

0:25:12.320,0:25:15.600
you can see that there's a couple

0:25:13.600,0:25:17.919
options here um it says for

0:25:15.600,0:25:19.679
all sprites or for this sprite only this

0:25:17.919,0:25:20.240
variable is for everybody in the whole

0:25:19.679,0:25:22.640
world

0:25:20.240,0:25:23.440
so the default of for all sprites was

0:25:22.640,0:25:25.520
correct

0:25:23.440,0:25:28.880
so i just need to type the word food and

0:25:25.520,0:25:31.120
then hit ok

0:25:28.880,0:25:33.200
now with variables you can see that it

0:25:31.120,0:25:34.640
shows it up here it says food zero

0:25:33.200,0:25:36.559
there's a couple things that we always

0:25:34.640,0:25:38.880
do with variables we always want to

0:25:36.559,0:25:39.679
set their initial value we want to

0:25:38.880,0:25:41.279
update them

0:25:39.679,0:25:43.039
at an appropriate time and then we want

0:25:41.279,0:25:45.440
to use them so

0:25:43.039,0:25:47.120
i want to set food to be one so i want

0:25:45.440,0:25:48.240
to set it to one when this program

0:25:47.120,0:25:49.760
starts up

0:25:48.240,0:25:52.240
i'm going to choose to put that code on

0:25:49.760,0:25:53.919
avery so click on avery

0:25:52.240,0:25:55.760
and so now we're back over in avery's

0:25:53.919,0:25:58.159
code

0:25:55.760,0:25:59.600
let's add some code to her what i want

0:25:58.159,0:26:02.559
to do is i want to add

0:25:59.600,0:26:03.039
set food to and so i'm going to drag

0:26:02.559,0:26:05.200
this

0:26:03.039,0:26:07.919
and i'm going to put it before the

0:26:05.200,0:26:07.919
forever loop

0:26:08.000,0:26:11.600
now just for fun that's where it goes

0:26:10.159,0:26:13.440
you should put it right there

0:26:11.600,0:26:15.440
i'm gonna i'm gonna pretend like i made

0:26:13.440,0:26:16.480
a mistake and show you how to fix a

0:26:15.440,0:26:18.799
mistake

0:26:16.480,0:26:19.760
so one thing that happens all the time

0:26:18.799,0:26:22.080
when you're coding

0:26:19.760,0:26:24.400
is you drop things in the wrong spot and

0:26:22.080,0:26:26.799
so let's say i drop this right here

0:26:24.400,0:26:28.480
oh no that's that's the wrong spot um so

0:26:26.799,0:26:30.480
the question is how do i fix it

0:26:28.480,0:26:32.799
the way you do it is you you drag it

0:26:30.480,0:26:33.200
over it brings everybody below it with

0:26:32.799,0:26:35.200
it

0:26:33.200,0:26:36.720
and then you drag the things that you

0:26:35.200,0:26:38.000
wanted back right so it's kind of a

0:26:36.720,0:26:39.760
two-step process

0:26:38.000,0:26:41.440
you'll get used to it with scratch so

0:26:39.760,0:26:43.200
where i want it is right here

0:26:41.440,0:26:44.880
and i want to set its initial value to

0:26:43.200,0:26:47.279
one

0:26:44.880,0:26:49.520
hey also while i'm over here let's go

0:26:47.279,0:26:51.760
ahead and make sure that avery starts in

0:26:49.520,0:26:54.080
the same spot each time in the game

0:26:51.760,0:26:55.440
so put avery to wherever you want her to

0:26:54.080,0:26:58.640
start at i'm going to have her start in

0:26:55.440,0:26:58.640
the bottom of her room here

0:26:59.360,0:27:07.840
and i want her to start there so that's

0:27:02.159,0:27:11.120
a motion command so click on motion

0:27:07.840,0:27:12.720
so i want the command go to x y

0:27:11.120,0:27:14.559
and i want to drop it in here at the

0:27:12.720,0:27:16.880
same time i set the variable

0:27:14.559,0:27:18.640
i'm going to set her initial position

0:27:16.880,0:27:20.080
your numbers don't have to be the same

0:27:18.640,0:27:21.919
as mine

0:27:20.080,0:27:23.840
and the nice thing about scratch is if

0:27:21.919,0:27:25.760
you've got her where you want her

0:27:23.840,0:27:27.600
those it's called the arguments will get

0:27:25.760,0:27:29.600
set correctly right so wherever

0:27:27.600,0:27:31.200
you put her in the right spot first then

0:27:29.600,0:27:33.200
you drag this command over

0:27:31.200,0:27:35.200
and things will work quite nicely so

0:27:33.200,0:27:37.200
start her somewhere weird

0:27:35.200,0:27:38.799
hit the green flag and you'll notice

0:27:37.200,0:27:40.640
that she'll go to your starting spot

0:27:38.799,0:27:42.880
each time so no matter where she's at

0:27:40.640,0:27:44.960
she'll go back to your starting spot all

0:27:42.880,0:27:46.720
right so this variable we made it we set

0:27:44.960,0:27:48.559
it to initial value

0:27:46.720,0:27:52.080
now let's see if we can change it at an

0:27:48.559,0:27:56.080
appropriate time click on your apple

0:27:52.080,0:27:58.080
so your apple um if he's touching avery

0:27:56.080,0:27:59.120
he needs to hide he needs to make a

0:27:58.080,0:28:00.320
chomp sound

0:27:59.120,0:28:01.760
by the way the order of those two

0:28:00.320,0:28:03.200
commands doesn't matter at all you can

0:28:01.760,0:28:05.440
have it swapped and that's fine

0:28:03.200,0:28:05.810
the other thing we want to do is we want

0:28:05.440,0:28:07.120
to

0:28:05.810,0:28:09.440
[Music]

0:28:07.120,0:28:10.559
increment the variable so let's just go

0:28:09.440,0:28:13.679
ahead and

0:28:10.559,0:28:13.679
quickly go to variables

0:28:14.320,0:28:20.640
and find change food by one

0:28:17.600,0:28:20.640
and drop it in here

0:28:21.300,0:28:26.080
[Music]

0:28:23.039,0:28:28.000
so let's go ahead and run it again and

0:28:26.080,0:28:29.600
this won't be that exciting but if you

0:28:28.000,0:28:32.720
notice food is currently one

0:28:29.600,0:28:33.440
but after i eat the apple food changes

0:28:32.720,0:28:38.640
to two

0:28:33.440,0:28:38.640
right so things are going pretty good

0:28:38.960,0:28:42.880
now the next thing we're going to do is

0:28:40.159,0:28:44.159
a little tricky so i want to only be

0:28:42.880,0:28:46.159
able to eat the apple

0:28:44.159,0:28:47.360
if food is currently one so here's what

0:28:46.159,0:28:49.279
i'm going to do

0:28:47.360,0:28:50.720
i'm going to take the code that i've got

0:28:49.279,0:28:53.919
in here

0:28:50.720,0:28:55.440
and i'm going to set it over to the side

0:28:53.919,0:28:58.000
so i still want that code but i'm just

0:28:55.440,0:28:59.440
going to set it over to the side

0:28:58.000,0:29:02.159
now what i want to do is i want to have

0:28:59.440,0:29:03.520
an if else statement

0:29:02.159,0:29:06.159
so we've we've learned about if

0:29:03.520,0:29:07.679
statements they were over in control

0:29:06.159,0:29:09.279
and this time what we want is we want

0:29:07.679,0:29:10.720
the more complex version it kind of

0:29:09.279,0:29:15.840
looks like a big letter e

0:29:10.720,0:29:15.840
and put in an if else statement

0:29:20.799,0:29:24.159
and so when we're touching avery we want

0:29:22.799,0:29:27.120
to check

0:29:24.159,0:29:28.240
is food equal to the correct number um

0:29:27.120,0:29:30.559
and in this case one

0:29:28.240,0:29:31.520
so if food is equal to one we want to

0:29:30.559,0:29:34.000
let you eat it

0:29:31.520,0:29:35.600
um if food is not one then we want to

0:29:34.000,0:29:37.039
show like an error message

0:29:35.600,0:29:41.120
so here's what we're gonna do we're

0:29:37.039,0:29:42.799
gonna go to operators

0:29:41.120,0:29:47.120
and we're gonna find the one that says

0:29:42.799,0:29:47.120
equals it's about six or seven down here

0:29:50.050,0:29:56.320
[Music]

0:29:53.039,0:29:58.320
and so if our variable food is equal to

0:29:56.320,0:30:00.320
the apples the first thing so if our

0:29:58.320,0:30:01.919
variable food is equal to one

0:30:00.320,0:30:04.480
then we're going to do stuff go into

0:30:01.919,0:30:04.480
variables

0:30:04.559,0:30:08.880
and drag food into that other white

0:30:06.840,0:30:10.399
circle

0:30:08.880,0:30:12.000
i did that kind of fast so if you need

0:30:10.399,0:30:14.080
to pause the video that's fine

0:30:12.000,0:30:15.600
but i went into operators and i grabbed

0:30:14.080,0:30:17.760
this equals

0:30:15.600,0:30:19.600
i changed the right hand side to b1 then

0:30:17.760,0:30:20.960
i went into variables and i grabbed food

0:30:19.600,0:30:24.000
and i put that on the left hand side

0:30:20.960,0:30:25.600
so if food is one then i want to do

0:30:24.000,0:30:29.039
this stuff that we were doing over here

0:30:25.600,0:30:29.039
so i'm going to drop this into the top

0:30:34.559,0:30:38.720
now what should we do if food is not one

0:30:37.360,0:30:40.240
does anybody want to say what we should

0:30:38.720,0:30:42.720
do if food is not one bowen do you have

0:30:40.240,0:30:44.240
any ideas

0:30:42.720,0:30:46.559
do you remember what uh what this

0:30:44.240,0:30:47.520
program did so if i tried to eat the

0:30:46.559,0:30:51.200
banana

0:30:47.520,0:30:53.520
what did it say yeah so if it's not the

0:30:51.200,0:30:55.370
right time we want to say a message

0:30:53.520,0:30:57.120
so let's go into looks

0:30:55.370,0:31:00.000
[Music]

0:30:57.120,0:31:02.399
um and grab this say hello for two

0:31:00.000,0:31:02.399
seconds

0:31:02.480,0:31:05.440
and then you should probably have an

0:31:03.840,0:31:06.720
adult type your message because it takes

0:31:05.440,0:31:08.480
forever to type

0:31:06.720,0:31:11.120
um so what i'm going to say is i'm going

0:31:08.480,0:31:13.679
to say keep trying

0:31:11.120,0:31:14.720
um oops sorry i'm going to say keep

0:31:13.679,0:31:19.000
trying

0:31:14.720,0:31:22.000
and then i'll say food should be eaten

0:31:19.000,0:31:22.000
alphabetically

0:31:23.039,0:31:27.919
now have an adult type that for you

0:31:25.360,0:31:30.080
because it takes a while to type

0:31:27.919,0:31:31.120
all right so let's go ahead and try it

0:31:30.080,0:31:33.120
now this time

0:31:31.120,0:31:34.799
we only have one food it's the apple

0:31:33.120,0:31:35.360
it's the correct time to eat the apple

0:31:34.799,0:31:38.080
so if you

0:31:35.360,0:31:39.679
if you hit the apple it should go chomp

0:31:38.080,0:31:42.159
um and it should be successful

0:31:39.679,0:31:42.880
we've never seen this message still

0:31:42.159,0:31:44.720
let's

0:31:42.880,0:31:46.960
make another sprite let's add some

0:31:44.720,0:31:48.159
bananas so to add another sprite this is

0:31:46.960,0:31:51.840
kind of a review

0:31:48.159,0:31:54.399
click on this green circle down here

0:31:51.840,0:31:55.840
and find the bananas for me it's still

0:31:54.399,0:31:57.200
pretty high in the order

0:31:55.840,0:31:59.440
by the way eventually we're going to go

0:31:57.200,0:32:00.559
to the food category and this will have

0:31:59.440,0:32:02.080
all the different foods we're going to

0:32:00.559,0:32:04.080
eat so i'm going to go with banana

0:32:02.080,0:32:06.080
if you want to do bread bread also

0:32:04.080,0:32:07.840
starts with b that'd be fine

0:32:06.080,0:32:09.279
if you want to eat a bowl i suppose you

0:32:07.840,0:32:11.679
could but i wouldn't recommend eating

0:32:09.279,0:32:11.679
bowls

0:32:11.840,0:32:15.679
i'm going to decide where the bananas

0:32:13.519,0:32:17.200
need to go into my figure i'm going to

0:32:15.679,0:32:18.640
make them a little sneaky

0:32:17.200,0:32:22.000
i'm going to say that these bananas are

0:32:18.640,0:32:22.000
sitting over here at the edge of the bed

0:32:22.159,0:32:27.760
now what we want to do is the bananas

0:32:25.600,0:32:28.880
need to have all the same code that the

0:32:27.760,0:32:31.360
apple had

0:32:28.880,0:32:33.200
the only thing that's different is

0:32:31.360,0:32:34.399
whether this food is equal to one or

0:32:33.200,0:32:36.480
food is equal to two

0:32:34.399,0:32:37.600
but it's mostly the exact same i do not

0:32:36.480,0:32:39.360
want to type it all

0:32:37.600,0:32:40.960
and sprite has a real or scratch has a

0:32:39.360,0:32:44.880
really good trick for this

0:32:40.960,0:32:45.919
go to the apple and drag the code from

0:32:44.880,0:32:48.799
the apple

0:32:45.919,0:32:50.640
um and drop it right here on the banana

0:32:48.799,0:32:52.000
it takes a little bit of getting used to

0:32:50.640,0:32:54.080
and you can see that whenever i did it

0:32:52.000,0:32:55.919
the banana kind of wiggled a little

0:32:54.080,0:32:58.320
and so if i drop it right there now it

0:32:55.919,0:33:00.480
it uh it's a copy paste is what happened

0:32:58.320,0:33:02.559
so now if i go to my apple i can see

0:33:00.480,0:33:04.799
that my apple has this code

0:33:02.559,0:33:05.600
and if i go to my banana the banana has

0:33:04.799,0:33:07.200
this code

0:33:05.600,0:33:09.200
i can tell that neel is struggling with

0:33:07.200,0:33:12.240
this drag and drop

0:33:09.200,0:33:14.399
mommy may have to help her some so both

0:33:12.240,0:33:16.000
of them have the same code

0:33:14.399,0:33:18.159
there's one thing that needs to be

0:33:16.000,0:33:21.120
different um and it's this

0:33:18.159,0:33:22.080
if food is equal to one the banana is

0:33:21.120,0:33:26.399
the second food

0:33:22.080,0:33:26.399
right so change it to a two

0:33:27.600,0:33:34.480
let's try it again so now

0:33:31.760,0:33:35.840
if i try to eat the banana first um

0:33:34.480,0:33:39.519
it'll say keep drying

0:33:35.840,0:33:42.080
food should be alphabetically

0:33:39.519,0:33:44.000
if i try to eat the apple first it'll

0:33:42.080,0:33:46.399
eat it

0:33:44.000,0:33:47.760
now i'm going to go eat the banana wow

0:33:46.399,0:33:50.159
so you can see it worked if we did the

0:33:47.760,0:33:51.679
banana

0:33:50.159,0:33:54.240
now we're going to mass produce some

0:33:51.679,0:33:55.519
food and my goal is for you to to do

0:33:54.240,0:33:56.799
this on your own

0:33:55.519,0:33:58.320
i'm going to help you kind of sort it

0:33:56.799,0:34:00.240
with one more and then i want you to

0:33:58.320,0:34:02.960
just kind of make a whole bunch

0:34:00.240,0:34:03.840
so to add the c i'm just going to do it

0:34:02.960,0:34:06.799
quickly here

0:34:03.840,0:34:08.480
i'm going to say choose a sprite i'm

0:34:06.799,0:34:10.560
going to click on food

0:34:08.480,0:34:13.200
and i'm going to pick a seafood i'm

0:34:10.560,0:34:16.480
going to pick cake

0:34:13.200,0:34:18.560
so now the cake is in here

0:34:16.480,0:34:21.839
and now i'm going to arrange the cake to

0:34:18.560,0:34:21.839
be a certain size

0:34:22.960,0:34:27.760
the cake then needs the same code

0:34:26.079,0:34:30.079
so i'm going to drag the code onto the

0:34:27.760,0:34:30.079
cake

0:34:31.919,0:34:36.800
and the cake is the third food so i

0:34:33.760,0:34:36.800
switch it to a three

0:34:36.879,0:34:41.200
so i want you to mass produce that um

0:34:39.520,0:34:41.839
for a couple different fruits maybe go

0:34:41.200,0:34:43.119
out to like

0:34:41.839,0:34:45.359
egg or if you want to you can go to

0:34:43.119,0:34:47.119
fortune cookie there's there's one

0:34:45.359,0:34:49.679
problem still with the sound

0:34:47.119,0:34:51.280
but we'll we'll fix that so i'm going to

0:34:49.679,0:34:52.720
pause the video

0:34:51.280,0:34:54.399
i'm going to let you add all the foods

0:34:52.720,0:34:56.320
that you want to add

0:34:54.399,0:34:57.440
and then we're going to fix the sounds

0:34:56.320,0:35:00.160
together after you add them

0:34:57.440,0:35:01.920
so pause the video and go add your foods

0:35:00.160,0:35:03.599
all right so our family had to take a

0:35:01.920,0:35:04.880
little break uh maybe you guys it's a

0:35:03.599,0:35:07.680
good time to take a break as well but

0:35:04.880,0:35:09.520
um i got mine added um so i've got apple

0:35:07.680,0:35:11.680
and it says food one check yours with me

0:35:09.520,0:35:13.599
so make sure your apple says food one

0:35:11.680,0:35:15.119
then click on your banana make sure it

0:35:13.599,0:35:17.119
says food too

0:35:15.119,0:35:18.480
your cake or whatever c you've got food

0:35:17.119,0:35:22.000
three

0:35:18.480,0:35:25.599
doughnut four egg

0:35:22.000,0:35:29.280
five fortune cookie six

0:35:25.599,0:35:32.400
now if you try it it will work right now

0:35:29.280,0:35:33.520
but the sounds may not work so when i

0:35:32.400,0:35:36.320
eat my apple

0:35:33.520,0:35:37.839
uh where'd my apple go to my apple's

0:35:36.320,0:35:40.880
right underneath my cake

0:35:37.839,0:35:43.520
when i eat my apple it made noise my

0:35:40.880,0:35:44.960
banana actually made noise

0:35:43.520,0:35:47.760
but then after that they quit making

0:35:44.960,0:35:48.800
noise um so why did that oh the donut

0:35:47.760,0:35:51.359
made noise

0:35:48.800,0:35:52.800
um so why do some make noise and others

0:35:51.359,0:35:54.560
don't make noise

0:35:52.800,0:35:56.800
i'm going to also move my cake a little

0:35:54.560,0:35:59.359
bit because my cake and my apple were

0:35:56.800,0:36:00.800
right on top of each other by the way

0:35:59.359,0:36:01.440
one trick for bringing them all back is

0:36:00.800,0:36:03.200
if you just hit

0:36:01.440,0:36:04.960
start and then stop immediately then

0:36:03.200,0:36:05.760
they all come back right so i like that

0:36:04.960,0:36:08.400
trick

0:36:05.760,0:36:09.760
since you can actually see things so why

0:36:08.400,0:36:12.640
didn't they make noise

0:36:09.760,0:36:13.920
so the apple you can see it says start

0:36:12.640,0:36:16.000
soundchomp

0:36:13.920,0:36:18.720
and then if you go to his tab he's got a

0:36:16.000,0:36:21.119
chomp sound so he's going to work fine

0:36:18.720,0:36:22.160
banana actually has the same code he

0:36:21.119,0:36:24.000
plays chomp

0:36:22.160,0:36:26.079
but you can see his sounds may not have

0:36:24.000,0:36:28.560
a chomp in it so what we want to do

0:36:26.079,0:36:31.280
is on the banana i want to switch it to

0:36:28.560,0:36:33.839
a sound that he does have so he has bite

0:36:31.280,0:36:35.520
on cake instead of chomp i want to

0:36:33.839,0:36:37.520
switch it to a sound he does have

0:36:35.520,0:36:39.839
i'm going to play birthday which is

0:36:37.520,0:36:41.040
actually a little long but that's okay

0:36:39.839,0:36:42.800
donut

0:36:41.040,0:36:44.640
instead of chomp i want i'll go with

0:36:42.800,0:36:46.079
bite

0:36:44.640,0:36:47.599
egg i think you see the pattern so

0:36:46.079,0:36:48.320
switch it to a sound he does have egg

0:36:47.599,0:36:50.880
has pop

0:36:48.320,0:36:53.359
that's fine and fortune cookie what's

0:36:50.880,0:36:56.079
fortune cookie guy he's got pop

0:36:53.359,0:36:58.160
oh well if you wanted to add more sounds

0:36:56.079,0:36:59.839
you could play around in the sound tab

0:36:58.160,0:37:01.599
but i quickly lose half an hour when i

0:36:59.839,0:37:03.200
let my kids go play in the sound tab

0:37:01.599,0:37:05.040
um so we're just going to fix like that

0:37:03.200,0:37:06.480
so now they should all make noise

0:37:05.040,0:37:09.200
so my campers are going to make a ton of

0:37:06.480,0:37:13.440
noise here so i get the apple

0:37:09.200,0:37:22.320
um banana birthday you're gonna hear

0:37:13.440,0:37:26.640
for like an hour

0:37:22.320,0:37:30.240
donut egg fortune cookie

0:37:26.640,0:37:32.320
cool so i think that worked pretty well

0:37:30.240,0:37:34.079
one advanced thing you can do by the way

0:37:32.320,0:37:35.440
on on the birthday cake its song was

0:37:34.079,0:37:36.960
kind of long

0:37:35.440,0:37:38.000
so you don't have to do this this is

0:37:36.960,0:37:39.440
optional i'm going to go into the

0:37:38.000,0:37:41.520
birthday cake and the sounds

0:37:39.440,0:37:43.119
and i'm going to click faster a few

0:37:41.520,0:37:44.800
times

0:37:43.119,0:37:47.599
and so it'll play a nice fast happy

0:37:44.800,0:37:50.240
birthday but it was taken too long

0:37:47.599,0:37:51.359
so i went into the sounds on cake and i

0:37:50.240,0:37:56.000
clicked faster

0:37:51.359,0:37:57.599
one or two times right all right

0:37:56.000,0:38:00.000
we're gonna add one more feature you

0:37:57.599,0:38:02.640
guys up for one more feature

0:38:00.000,0:38:04.240
one more feature when the game is over

0:38:02.640,0:38:06.000
nothing happens

0:38:04.240,0:38:07.359
and it would be kind of nice if

0:38:06.000,0:38:09.760
something happened

0:38:07.359,0:38:10.960
that said like congratulations or a

0:38:09.760,0:38:12.560
great job or you win

0:38:10.960,0:38:14.560
or something like that so we're going to

0:38:12.560,0:38:17.200
add one more piece of code

0:38:14.560,0:38:19.119
to avery so click on your avery sprite

0:38:17.200,0:38:20.720
her code should look like this

0:38:19.119,0:38:22.400
and we're going to add an if statement

0:38:20.720,0:38:25.040
in here so the if statements were over

0:38:22.400,0:38:25.040
in control

0:38:25.359,0:38:29.680
in the control area find if

0:38:30.720,0:38:33.920
and just like we did for all the foods

0:38:32.320,0:38:36.000
we're gonna see if that variable

0:38:33.920,0:38:37.440
is a certain number you can see that i

0:38:36.000,0:38:40.400
had six foods

0:38:37.440,0:38:41.599
so my variable ends at a seven so for

0:38:40.400,0:38:45.280
avery

0:38:41.599,0:38:46.960
i'm gonna say if food is equal to seven

0:38:45.280,0:38:48.720
then i'm going to play congratulations

0:38:46.960,0:38:51.520
you win things like that so i'm gonna go

0:38:48.720,0:38:51.520
to operators

0:38:51.760,0:38:57.839
i'm gonna find the equals operator

0:38:55.280,0:39:01.359
this is just like we did before i'm

0:38:57.839,0:39:05.119
gonna do variables

0:39:01.359,0:39:05.119
i'm gonna do food is equal to seven

0:39:05.280,0:39:07.760
all right so i've got that in there if

0:39:06.640,0:39:09.040
you ever need to pause it by the way

0:39:07.760,0:39:09.520
just pause the video and put that in

0:39:09.040,0:39:11.359
there

0:39:09.520,0:39:14.040
so when we win the game we wanna do a

0:39:11.359,0:39:15.440
couple things first i want to say

0:39:14.040,0:39:19.839
congratulations

0:39:15.440,0:39:19.839
so saying things is over in looks

0:39:20.480,0:39:23.760
and i this time i do care which i grab i

0:39:22.800,0:39:26.320
want to make sure to grab

0:39:23.760,0:39:29.680
say hello without any time delay on it

0:39:26.320,0:39:31.680
so i just want to say say hello

0:39:29.680,0:39:33.200
and you can put whatever congratulations

0:39:31.680,0:39:34.720
message you want again you might want to

0:39:33.200,0:39:37.359
have an adult type for you

0:39:34.720,0:39:39.839
so i'm going to say you win alphabet

0:39:37.359,0:39:39.839
breakfast

0:39:40.640,0:39:44.160
so type whatever message you'd like and

0:39:42.800,0:39:45.520
make sure it's the version that doesn't

0:39:44.160,0:39:47.359
have the delay on it

0:39:45.520,0:39:49.200
alright so i typed that for my camper

0:39:47.359,0:39:52.560
now we're ready to add a sound

0:39:49.200,0:39:55.040
now avery only has the sound of pop

0:39:52.560,0:39:55.760
that's not good enough i want a funner

0:39:55.040,0:39:58.640
sound

0:39:55.760,0:40:00.400
so make sure you've got avery selected

0:39:58.640,0:40:02.640
go to her sound area

0:40:00.400,0:40:04.480
and let's add a new sound so come down

0:40:02.640,0:40:07.760
here to the lower left corner

0:40:04.480,0:40:07.760
and say choose a sound

0:40:07.839,0:40:11.760
and the sound i want you to add is dance

0:40:10.160,0:40:13.839
celebration

0:40:11.760,0:40:15.119
so there's a couple ways to find dance

0:40:13.839,0:40:17.119
celebration

0:40:15.119,0:40:18.960
i chose to type in part of the word

0:40:17.119,0:40:19.839
dance because i knew that it was one of

0:40:18.960,0:40:21.520
the options

0:40:19.839,0:40:23.119
and i can see right here the second one

0:40:21.520,0:40:24.319
is dance celebration

0:40:23.119,0:40:27.119
so i'm going to click in the middle of

0:40:24.319,0:40:30.160
this white box

0:40:27.119,0:40:32.400
now that i've added the sound avery can

0:40:30.160,0:40:35.119
now play the sound in our code right

0:40:32.400,0:40:37.200
so i've added the sound here then i go

0:40:35.119,0:40:40.560
into the code

0:40:37.200,0:40:41.359
and on sounds this time i want play

0:40:40.560,0:40:44.400
sound

0:40:41.359,0:40:45.520
until done so i'm going to play this

0:40:44.400,0:40:47.280
sound

0:40:45.520,0:40:50.800
and it defaulted to dance celebration

0:40:47.280,0:40:52.319
for me which was nice until done

0:40:50.800,0:40:55.440
and then the very last thing i'm going

0:40:52.319,0:41:00.720
to do is i'm going to end the program

0:40:55.440,0:41:00.720
so after i drag on play sound until done

0:41:01.119,0:41:08.000
i'm the last going to grab a stop all

0:41:04.560,0:41:10.720
so it's in control it's near the bottom

0:41:08.000,0:41:12.720
and it's a stop all now make sure that

0:41:10.720,0:41:15.359
this gets dropped into the correct spot

0:41:12.720,0:41:16.079
so it needs to go i'm inside this inner

0:41:15.359,0:41:19.040
loop

0:41:16.079,0:41:20.240
and that's our last line of code so it's

0:41:19.040,0:41:21.520
time to try it

0:41:20.240,0:41:23.520
um and then i'm gonna walk around i'm

0:41:21.520,0:41:26.800
gonna see how my campers did

0:41:23.520,0:41:29.760
so what should happen now is i should be

0:41:26.800,0:41:34.000
able to play my game

0:41:29.760,0:41:37.520
banana cake

0:41:34.000,0:41:40.319
donut egg and then whenever i get the

0:41:37.520,0:41:40.319

0:44:14.640,0:44:16.560
right did you guys have fun building

0:44:16.000,0:44:19.119
your uh

0:44:16.560,0:44:20.400
building your program today yes all

0:44:19.119,0:44:22.319
right

0:44:20.400,0:44:24.319
i want to say one last thing before we

0:44:22.319,0:44:24.800
let you go uh so campers you can just

0:44:24.319,0:44:27.599
kind of

0:44:24.800,0:44:29.200
bear with me and listen if you want to

0:44:27.599,0:44:31.920
uh publish your project

0:44:29.200,0:44:33.680
you can click on the word share here and

0:44:31.920,0:44:35.680
it'll make a public page

0:44:33.680,0:44:37.119
that other people can look at you do

0:44:35.680,0:44:39.520
have to be signed in

0:44:37.119,0:44:41.680
to do that and then this url right here

0:44:39.520,0:44:44.560
you could send to a friend or family and

0:44:41.680,0:44:47.119
then they could see your project as well

0:44:44.560,0:44:48.720
so i think that's all i've got really i

0:44:47.119,0:44:50.880
just wanted to make sure that you

0:44:48.720,0:44:52.240
know a couple things you can sit on my

0:44:50.880,0:44:54.560
lap

0:44:52.240,0:44:55.920
first off is coding is fun uh you can

0:44:54.560,0:44:58.079
totally do it

0:44:55.920,0:44:59.920
neila is five this is her first coding

0:44:58.079,0:45:02.160
experience ever

0:44:59.920,0:45:03.920
and she's learning little bits at a time

0:45:02.160,0:45:05.040
right but we hopefully know that

0:45:03.920,0:45:07.440
different sprites

0:45:05.040,0:45:08.160
have different code the code runs in

0:45:07.440,0:45:09.440
order

0:45:08.160,0:45:11.599
and there's lots of great things we

0:45:09.440,0:45:12.640
learned today but we've got a whole week

0:45:11.599,0:45:14.480
of this

0:45:12.640,0:45:15.680
and each day will hopefully get easier

0:45:14.480,0:45:17.680
and easier for you

0:45:15.680,0:45:20.800
so we loved having you join us we hope

0:45:17.680,0:45:20.800
to see you again tomorrow

0:45:21.130,0:45:27.119
