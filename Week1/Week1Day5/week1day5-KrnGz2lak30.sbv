0:00:00.390,0:00:07.200
[Music]

0:00:04.640,0:00:09.040
hey hey welcome to the final day of code

0:00:07.200,0:00:10.160
camp uh you made it to day five

0:00:09.040,0:00:11.840
congratulations

0:00:10.160,0:00:14.080
uh what we're going to be doing today is

0:00:11.840,0:00:15.519
something called kaleidoscope dessert

0:00:14.080,0:00:17.520
uh and as i kind of teased about

0:00:15.519,0:00:18.800
mckinley is going to be leading this one

0:00:17.520,0:00:20.960
uh so you're going to see her in just a

0:00:18.800,0:00:22.160
minute before i let her take the stage i

0:00:20.960,0:00:23.519
want to kind of review a couple things

0:00:22.160,0:00:25.199
we learned last time just because it's a

0:00:23.519,0:00:27.760
really good way to learn

0:00:25.199,0:00:29.439
so last time was the the catching dinner

0:00:27.760,0:00:30.320
uh we learned a lot of new skills and

0:00:29.439,0:00:32.559
that we learned

0:00:30.320,0:00:34.559
that you could use a command called

0:00:32.559,0:00:35.920
change the x by so you could actually

0:00:34.559,0:00:38.079
just change the x

0:00:35.920,0:00:40.160
which is the side to side and change the

0:00:38.079,0:00:41.600
y to go up and down

0:00:40.160,0:00:43.760
we learned that you could put code on

0:00:41.600,0:00:45.280
the stage so we had never put code on

0:00:43.760,0:00:46.719
the stage before but you have code that

0:00:45.280,0:00:48.399
you can put on each sprite

0:00:46.719,0:00:50.640
which is a good thing that you can do

0:00:48.399,0:00:52.160
but you can also put code on your stage

0:00:50.640,0:00:53.360
the stage is also sometimes called the

0:00:52.160,0:00:55.360
background

0:00:53.360,0:00:57.120
and what we did with that stage code is

0:00:55.360,0:00:59.359
we created clones

0:00:57.120,0:01:00.559
so cloning was really the big concept we

0:00:59.359,0:01:02.079
learned last time

0:01:00.559,0:01:04.080
and that's instead of having an

0:01:02.079,0:01:06.159
individual sprite down there

0:01:04.080,0:01:07.680
you have one sprite and then many clones

0:01:06.159,0:01:08.960
of it on your game it's a really

0:01:07.680,0:01:11.520
powerful concept

0:01:08.960,0:01:12.000
in programming we also did some more

0:01:11.520,0:01:13.840
things with

0:01:12.000,0:01:16.720
random numbers uh so hopefully you kind

0:01:13.840,0:01:18.640
of got some of those concepts uh down

0:01:16.720,0:01:20.080
today what we're doing is uh kind of

0:01:18.640,0:01:21.200
something completely different it's a

0:01:20.080,0:01:23.200
lightweight thing

0:01:21.200,0:01:24.640
it's kind of what i call like a half day

0:01:23.200,0:01:26.000
it's just meant to be a fun way to

0:01:24.640,0:01:27.360
finish our week

0:01:26.000,0:01:29.680
and so let me go ahead and start off by

0:01:27.360,0:01:32.000
clicking on this solution demo

0:01:29.680,0:01:33.280
and you can kind of see what we're up to

0:01:32.000,0:01:36.240
so to stick with our

0:01:33.280,0:01:37.680
dessert theme we made it kind of like as

0:01:36.240,0:01:38.880
though you're putting icing on the top

0:01:37.680,0:01:40.640
of a cake

0:01:38.880,0:01:42.000
but really it has almost nothing to do

0:01:40.640,0:01:44.640
with dessert

0:01:42.000,0:01:45.920
and the idea is is that you can ice the

0:01:44.640,0:01:47.360
top of a cake

0:01:45.920,0:01:49.680
i'm missing my background image here but

0:01:47.360,0:01:51.119
that's okay and so if i was putting

0:01:49.680,0:01:53.600
icing on a cake

0:01:51.119,0:01:55.439
i could decorate the top of my cake what

0:01:53.600,0:01:55.920
i'm doing here to do this and you'll see

0:01:55.439,0:01:57.920
when you

0:01:55.920,0:01:59.280
when you start doing it is i'm using the

0:01:57.920,0:02:01.600
arrow keys

0:01:59.280,0:02:02.320
so if i hit the up arrow i'm actually

0:02:01.600,0:02:05.119
controlling

0:02:02.320,0:02:06.719
three sprites at once so if i press

0:02:05.119,0:02:08.319
arrow that goes forwards

0:02:06.719,0:02:10.160
if i press arrow and right it kind of

0:02:08.319,0:02:11.920
like turns to the right some

0:02:10.160,0:02:13.760
um and the neat thing that you can do

0:02:11.920,0:02:15.760
here with a kaleidoscope

0:02:13.760,0:02:16.879
is you can make cool uh shapes and

0:02:15.760,0:02:19.440
patterns with it

0:02:16.879,0:02:20.480
so that's what we're up to uh so what i

0:02:19.440,0:02:22.000
want you to do

0:02:20.480,0:02:24.319
i'm supposed to say what we're going to

0:02:22.000,0:02:25.040
learn today as well but what i want you

0:02:24.319,0:02:30.400
to do

0:02:25.040,0:02:33.920
is go ahead and open up scratch.mit.edu

0:02:30.400,0:02:34.959
and create a new project and i am going

0:02:33.920,0:02:37.840
to get that far

0:02:34.959,0:02:38.800
done and then i'm going to turn it over

0:02:37.840,0:02:40.160
to mckinley

0:02:38.800,0:02:42.480
so mckinley you want to take the lead

0:02:40.160,0:02:42.480
from here

0:02:42.959,0:02:46.160
hi my name is mckinley fisher and i'm

0:02:45.120,0:02:48.959
going to be teaching

0:02:46.160,0:02:49.680
um today's lesson and so our campers

0:02:48.959,0:02:54.160
today

0:02:49.680,0:02:57.760
are mila bone

0:02:54.160,0:03:00.319
keegan and daddy

0:02:57.760,0:03:01.599
dave all right go ahead let's go ahead

0:03:00.319,0:03:03.360
and get started

0:03:01.599,0:03:06.080
so the first thing you need to do is

0:03:03.360,0:03:07.920
delete your cat sprite

0:03:06.080,0:03:10.560
after that you're going to go into the

0:03:07.920,0:03:11.519
cat on the sprite library to choose a

0:03:10.560,0:03:13.840
new sprite

0:03:11.519,0:03:16.159
the sprite you're going to choose is the

0:03:13.840,0:03:16.159
ball

0:03:16.959,0:03:20.159
once you get the ball it should look

0:03:18.319,0:03:24.319
like this

0:03:20.159,0:03:27.360
and then you can go into events

0:03:24.319,0:03:28.239
and get the green flagged so so far you

0:03:27.360,0:03:30.400
should have

0:03:28.239,0:03:33.360
your ball on your screen and green flag

0:03:30.400,0:03:35.680
in the code

0:03:33.360,0:03:36.560
after that you need to tell the ball

0:03:35.680,0:03:40.319
where to go

0:03:36.560,0:03:40.319
and that is found in motion

0:03:40.720,0:03:45.360
you need to drag over a go to x and y

0:03:43.360,0:03:48.400
block

0:03:45.360,0:03:51.040
and you change it to zero

0:03:48.400,0:03:53.519
zero so it'll be in the middle of the

0:03:51.040,0:03:53.519
screen

0:03:56.319,0:04:00.560
after that you um drag over a point and

0:03:59.280,0:04:03.760
direction block

0:04:00.560,0:04:07.519
right now it should have 90 in it

0:04:03.760,0:04:10.959
you're gonna change that 90 to zero

0:04:07.519,0:04:15.840
so so far your this is what your code

0:04:10.959,0:04:15.840
should look like along with your ball

0:04:16.639,0:04:20.400
after that you're going to go into

0:04:18.479,0:04:23.519
control and drag over

0:04:20.400,0:04:23.519
a forever loop

0:04:26.160,0:04:43.120
then you're going to drag over four

0:04:30.000,0:04:46.960
if statements once you do that you're

0:04:43.120,0:04:51.199
going to go into sensing

0:04:46.960,0:04:57.600
and drag over if he pressed

0:04:51.199,0:04:59.360
into those little boxes

0:04:57.600,0:05:01.520
so right now your code should look like

0:04:59.360,0:05:05.360
this uh when green flied

0:05:01.520,0:05:07.520
go to um x and y point and direction

0:05:05.360,0:05:08.960
a forever loop with four if statements

0:05:07.520,0:05:14.080
inside and inside this

0:05:08.960,0:05:14.080
if statements key space press

0:05:14.160,0:05:17.600
once you have that you're going to

0:05:15.520,0:05:22.479
change the spaces

0:05:17.600,0:05:22.479
to up arrow for the first if statement

0:05:22.880,0:05:27.360
down arrow for the second if statement

0:05:28.400,0:05:36.400
left for the third statement

0:05:31.600,0:05:36.400
and right for the fourth statement

0:05:36.960,0:05:44.000
once you do that or um you can go into

0:05:40.479,0:05:47.120
motion again so that um your ball will

0:05:44.000,0:05:49.280
actually move when you press these keys

0:05:47.120,0:05:50.479
for the up arrow you're going to drag

0:05:49.280,0:05:53.919
over a move

0:05:50.479,0:05:58.430
10 steps and you're going to

0:05:53.919,0:06:00.319
change that 10 steps to 3 steps

0:05:58.430,0:06:02.319
[Music]

0:06:00.319,0:06:04.840
and then you're going to drag over and

0:06:02.319,0:06:07.759
move 10 steps into the down

0:06:04.840,0:06:12.720
arrow and make

0:06:07.759,0:06:12.720
that 10 be a negative three steps

0:06:12.790,0:06:16.720
[Music]

0:06:15.199,0:06:19.360
once you do that you're going to get

0:06:16.720,0:06:23.680
into the turns for the

0:06:19.360,0:06:25.280
left arrow you are going to want to drag

0:06:23.680,0:06:28.560
this one over

0:06:25.280,0:06:31.360
which one's this one the lower

0:06:28.560,0:06:31.360
turn one

0:06:31.759,0:06:35.840
that has its arrow pointing left

0:06:38.000,0:06:43.440
and you're gonna change that 15 degrees

0:06:40.800,0:06:43.440
to five

0:06:44.639,0:06:48.960
and then once you do that you're going

0:06:46.479,0:06:52.000
to take the top term one

0:06:48.960,0:06:52.000
that's pointing right

0:06:52.800,0:06:59.039
and change that to five so right now

0:06:56.479,0:07:02.800
your code should have

0:06:59.039,0:07:04.620
um move or turn blocks

0:07:02.800,0:07:06.319
inside those if statements

0:07:04.620,0:07:09.599
[Music]

0:07:06.319,0:07:12.960
after that you're going to go into this

0:07:09.599,0:07:12.960
extension button

0:07:13.120,0:07:16.479
once you click on it your screen should

0:07:14.800,0:07:18.639
look like this

0:07:16.479,0:07:19.840
and you're going to see there's a lot of

0:07:18.639,0:07:24.400
different options

0:07:19.840,0:07:24.400
but the one we want is pen

0:07:24.800,0:07:27.919
once you do that you should see it opens

0:07:26.960,0:07:30.960
up an um

0:07:27.919,0:07:34.319
whole new block area that have

0:07:30.960,0:07:36.240
teal colored blocks once you do that

0:07:34.319,0:07:38.639
you're gonna grab um drag the first

0:07:36.240,0:07:43.039
command erase all

0:07:38.639,0:07:44.960
in between before the forever group for

0:07:43.039,0:07:46.960
before the forever loop and after the

0:07:44.960,0:07:48.670
point in direction zero

0:07:46.960,0:07:51.120
so your code should look like this

0:07:48.670,0:07:54.400
[Music]

0:07:51.120,0:07:57.680
and then um you're going to drag over a

0:07:54.400,0:07:58.080
stamp block and put it under the move

0:07:57.680,0:08:00.800
three

0:07:58.080,0:08:01.919
steps so now move your bottle and move

0:08:00.800,0:08:04.960
three steps and then

0:08:01.919,0:08:08.639
stamp and then

0:08:04.960,0:08:11.360
you're going to um for the down arrow

0:08:08.639,0:08:12.240
um this is optional you can do the same

0:08:11.360,0:08:15.440
thing

0:08:12.240,0:08:17.360
i'm going to um so that your ball makes

0:08:15.440,0:08:19.360
a line whenever it moves backwards

0:08:17.360,0:08:23.280
you don't have to do this it is

0:08:19.360,0:08:23.280
completely optional and up to you

0:08:25.199,0:08:30.479
once you do that you should be able to

0:08:28.560,0:08:32.959
move your ball around and it has a line

0:08:30.479,0:08:36.000
underneath it

0:08:32.959,0:08:38.479
and also if you would like your ball a

0:08:36.000,0:08:40.080
little faster you can change this move

0:08:38.479,0:08:42.560
three steps and move negative three

0:08:40.080,0:08:42.560
steps

0:08:43.309,0:08:47.839
[Music]

0:08:44.800,0:08:50.800
okay now that you have that um

0:08:47.839,0:08:51.760
you can duplicate this and how you do

0:08:50.800,0:08:55.120
that

0:08:51.760,0:08:58.560
is you click on the sprite and it should

0:08:55.120,0:09:00.480
show up with a duplicate and you're

0:08:58.560,0:09:03.519
going to hit that

0:09:00.480,0:09:06.399
so now you should have ball and ball too

0:09:03.519,0:09:06.399
right click yes

0:09:07.600,0:09:12.160
now there's it should be two balls

0:09:13.200,0:09:17.519
and now you do that one more time so

0:09:15.519,0:09:21.440
there is going to be

0:09:17.519,0:09:22.000
three balls duplicate so now you should

0:09:21.440,0:09:25.440
have

0:09:22.000,0:09:25.440
three balls on your screen

0:09:25.680,0:09:31.040
and now you can

0:09:28.880,0:09:32.320
change the balls colors if you would

0:09:31.040,0:09:35.680
like

0:09:32.320,0:09:39.200
to do that you go into ball

0:09:35.680,0:09:41.920
and then you click on costumes

0:09:39.200,0:09:44.160
you'll see it already has um a bunch of

0:09:41.920,0:09:45.760
different colored costumes

0:09:44.160,0:09:48.480
and you can choose whichever one you

0:09:45.760,0:09:51.120
would like but i'm going to choose blue

0:09:48.480,0:09:54.800
and also if you would like you can um

0:09:51.120,0:09:54.800
fill the ball of your own color

0:09:55.360,0:09:59.360
so now there's um and then you can do

0:09:58.240,0:10:02.000
the same for the

0:09:59.360,0:10:04.320
other balls so you click on the ball

0:10:02.000,0:10:08.000
then you click on its costumes

0:10:04.320,0:10:08.000
and choose a color you would like

0:10:17.600,0:10:20.880
once you do that um you'll see in the

0:10:20.240,0:10:23.120
code

0:10:20.880,0:10:24.160
for ball two and three it has the exact

0:10:23.120,0:10:27.040
same code

0:10:24.160,0:10:28.399
we want to um modify this code just a

0:10:27.040,0:10:31.200
bit

0:10:28.399,0:10:33.200
and so you're gonna change it so it says

0:10:31.200,0:10:35.600
one green flag to go to

0:10:33.200,0:10:36.480
x and y zero zero and then point in

0:10:35.600,0:10:39.279
direction

0:10:36.480,0:10:39.760
zero you want to change that zero to one

0:10:39.279,0:10:42.160
hundred

0:10:39.760,0:10:42.160
twenty

0:10:44.480,0:10:49.120
and then you're going to go into ball

0:10:47.360,0:10:51.440
three

0:10:49.120,0:10:52.160
and do almost the same thing except it's

0:10:51.440,0:10:54.910
going to be

0:10:52.160,0:10:57.200
a negative 120.

0:10:54.910,0:10:59.200
[Music]

0:10:57.200,0:11:00.720
once you do that and click the green

0:10:59.200,0:11:04.320
flag you should have

0:11:00.720,0:11:06.320
a kaleidoscope you made and you can um

0:11:04.320,0:11:08.240
have whatever colors you want and change

0:11:06.320,0:11:11.519
it

0:11:08.240,0:11:14.560
and um since it is cool

0:11:11.519,0:11:15.519
since it is kaleidoscope dessert we need

0:11:14.560,0:11:19.120
a background

0:11:15.519,0:11:21.600
which is going to be our cake

0:11:19.120,0:11:24.000
so you could draw your own but i'm going

0:11:21.600,0:11:25.680
to click on choose a background

0:11:24.000,0:11:29.760
and i'm going to choose a background

0:11:25.680,0:11:33.279
that i think looks like a cake

0:11:29.760,0:11:34.959
i like this heart i'm going to click on

0:11:33.279,0:11:35.680
it and now i'm going to have a heart

0:11:34.959,0:11:42.640
background

0:11:35.680,0:11:45.920
and um my balls kind of look like icing

0:11:42.640,0:11:48.720
so to do that your

0:11:45.920,0:11:51.760
project should look like this and now

0:11:48.720,0:11:57.040
you're going to give your project a name

0:11:51.760,0:11:57.040
i'm going to name mine kaleidoscope

0:12:00.720,0:12:04.240
okay um now that your project has a name

0:12:03.440,0:12:07.600
you can go

0:12:04.240,0:12:10.000
into file and hit save now

0:12:07.600,0:12:10.880
so now your project should be saved and

0:12:10.000,0:12:13.200
you're going to hit

0:12:10.880,0:12:13.200
share

0:12:15.200,0:12:19.519
in the instructions you can just tell

0:12:17.519,0:12:22.959
people to

0:12:19.519,0:12:25.839
use the arrow

0:12:22.959,0:12:25.839
arrow keys

0:12:27.680,0:12:33.360
and then there's also a url

0:12:30.880,0:12:35.680
you can share to your friends if you

0:12:33.360,0:12:40.320
would like

0:12:35.680,0:12:43.200
and so now let's see how our campers did

0:12:40.320,0:12:45.120
so now let's see how nina did can you

0:12:43.200,0:12:48.040
show us your project

0:12:45.120,0:12:49.440
whoa you're decorating your cake with

0:12:48.040,0:12:52.560
unicorns

0:12:49.440,0:12:57.200
great idea

0:12:52.560,0:13:01.839
okay now let's see how bowen did

0:12:57.200,0:13:05.600
i like your cake different colors

0:13:01.839,0:13:08.800
nice now let's see

0:13:05.600,0:13:08.800
how daddy did

0:13:10.000,0:13:15.760
he did his cake and he even gave one of

0:13:12.639,0:13:15.760
his balls a face

0:13:17.360,0:13:22.240
thank you now let's see how keaton did

0:13:24.639,0:13:31.760
very nice um this is one way to make it

0:13:28.560,0:13:34.399
i have um made an extension

0:13:31.760,0:13:35.600
extension i made i called it rainbow

0:13:34.399,0:13:37.480
worms

0:13:35.600,0:13:38.959
and so it looks like this

0:13:37.480,0:13:43.360
[Music]

0:13:38.959,0:13:43.360
and then you can move using this

0:13:43.760,0:13:47.920
and then you have a rainbow worm in the

0:13:45.920,0:13:49.160
middle that you activate with space and

0:13:47.920,0:13:51.839
then you use

0:13:49.160,0:13:55.680
wasd to move it

0:13:51.839,0:13:59.680
and so that is an extension you can

0:13:55.680,0:14:03.650
make and now i'm going to turn it back

0:13:59.680,0:14:04.959
over to daddy

0:14:03.650,0:14:08.320
[Music]

0:14:04.959,0:14:11.120
all right so that is the end folks uh

0:14:08.320,0:14:13.040
so uh kaleidoscope dessert was the final

0:14:11.120,0:14:15.279
thing that we wanted to teach you about

0:14:13.040,0:14:16.720
um we just kind of wanted to ramp up

0:14:15.279,0:14:17.440
camp a little bit and say a couple

0:14:16.720,0:14:18.880
things

0:14:17.440,0:14:20.720
the real take-home message from this

0:14:18.880,0:14:22.560
camp is coding is fun it's something you

0:14:20.720,0:14:24.320
can do you can totally do this

0:14:22.560,0:14:26.720
you'll see coding in your life just know

0:14:24.320,0:14:29.519
that it is something that you can handle

0:14:26.720,0:14:30.000
each day we work through a different app

0:14:29.519,0:14:31.199
or

0:14:30.000,0:14:33.360
project whatever you want to call it in

0:14:31.199,0:14:34.720
this camp we started with alphabet

0:14:33.360,0:14:37.440
breakfast where we worked on like

0:14:34.720,0:14:39.519
sprites and variables and flow control

0:14:37.440,0:14:41.199
day two was hedgehog snack where we did

0:14:39.519,0:14:42.399
some things with drawing and touching

0:14:41.199,0:14:44.399
color

0:14:42.399,0:14:46.320
day three was fish lunch it was the big

0:14:44.399,0:14:49.279
one where we did like movement control

0:14:46.320,0:14:50.800
and broadcasting events uh day four was

0:14:49.279,0:14:52.800
catching dinner where we learned about

0:14:50.800,0:14:54.800
clones and random numbers

0:14:52.800,0:14:56.240
uh and then day five was kaleidoscope

0:14:54.800,0:14:57.760
dessert

0:14:56.240,0:14:59.360
um each of these is just kind of meant

0:14:57.760,0:15:01.040
to teach you some different concepts let

0:14:59.360,0:15:02.560
you kind of get familiar with computer

0:15:01.040,0:15:04.720
science a little bit

0:15:02.560,0:15:06.000
if you want more there's a whole another

0:15:04.720,0:15:07.680
week of this camp

0:15:06.000,0:15:09.360
fair warning it is meant for an older

0:15:07.680,0:15:10.720
audience so some of those projects get

0:15:09.360,0:15:12.000
intense right

0:15:10.720,0:15:14.000
but if you wanted to give a shot we

0:15:12.000,0:15:16.160
certainly welcome having you there

0:15:14.000,0:15:17.600
but i wanted to say thanks for my whole

0:15:16.160,0:15:19.440
family for joining us

0:15:17.600,0:15:20.880
it's been a great camp week we hope that

0:15:19.440,0:15:25.930
you really liked it all right
