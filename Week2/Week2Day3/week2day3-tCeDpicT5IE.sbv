because we put the hardest one on day

0:00:12.960,0:00:16.240
three it's just kind of how we do the

0:00:14.639,0:00:17.840

better and better and so wednesday is

0:00:17.840,0:00:20.080
like when you're ready to tackle the

0:00:19.119,0:00:22.080
hardest thing

0:00:20.080,0:00:23.519
uh and then it'll get easier uh after

0:00:22.080,0:00:25.119
that thursday's a little easier

0:00:23.519,0:00:27.039
friday's usually kind of like a half day

0:00:25.119,0:00:27.680
right so today we're going to tackle

0:00:27.039,0:00:30.080
something

0:00:27.680,0:00:31.840
uh something big i'm here with my

0:00:30.080,0:00:33.760
campers again as per usual

0:00:31.840,0:00:35.440
uh campers are you ready to tackle

0:00:33.760,0:00:38.480
something huge today

0:00:35.440,0:00:39.120
yeah are you ready to go we'll see we'll

0:00:38.480,0:00:41.840
see

0:00:39.120,0:00:43.360
um i will say that like it is literally

0:00:41.840,0:00:45.600
so big you may want to plan

0:00:43.360,0:00:46.879
to do this video like part of it now and

0:00:45.600,0:00:48.800
then part of it later

0:00:46.879,0:00:50.640
because it's it's a big one right it's

0:00:48.800,0:00:53.199
good for you though

0:00:50.640,0:00:55.840
uh let's uh let's see what we're making

0:00:53.199,0:00:58.239
so i've got a demo solution on here

0:00:55.840,0:00:58.960
now normally the demo solution i just

0:00:58.239,0:01:01.520
kind of show

0:00:58.960,0:01:02.640
pretty quickly just for what we're

0:01:01.520,0:01:04.159
trying to do

0:01:02.640,0:01:06.640
but this time what i want to do is i

0:01:04.159,0:01:08.320
want you to think about

0:01:06.640,0:01:09.680
what types of things you would have to

0:01:08.320,0:01:11.200
write in the code so what are some

0:01:09.680,0:01:12.000
things and i'll say some out loud as

0:01:11.200,0:01:14.159
we're doing it

0:01:12.000,0:01:15.280
um but here's how the game works so when

0:01:14.159,0:01:18.320
i hit the play button

0:01:15.280,0:01:20.640
uh this game is called irish sheepdog i

0:01:18.320,0:01:21.360
am the irish sheepdog so i'm running

0:01:20.640,0:01:23.439
around

0:01:21.360,0:01:24.720
um and what i'm doing is i'm trying to

0:01:23.439,0:01:27.119
push sheep

0:01:24.720,0:01:29.040
into the pen and you can see that the

0:01:27.119,0:01:30.000
way that i push them is i get behind

0:01:29.040,0:01:32.640
them

0:01:30.000,0:01:34.320
and then i drive them into the pen

0:01:32.640,0:01:35.600
driving the dog around is actually kind

0:01:34.320,0:01:39.520
of hard

0:01:35.600,0:01:42.399
he uses up arrow to go forwards

0:01:39.520,0:01:44.240
and then he turns with left and right

0:01:42.399,0:01:46.399
and then he can also go backwards that's

0:01:44.240,0:01:49.119
just kind of a feature of the dog

0:01:46.399,0:01:49.520
and whenever he's touching the sheep the

0:01:49.119,0:01:53.040
sheep

0:01:49.520,0:01:54.560
go into the pin one trick you can do

0:01:53.040,0:01:55.520
which is kind of fun is backwards you

0:01:54.560,0:01:57.280
don't push sheep

0:01:55.520,0:01:58.640
so you kind of like back over the top of

0:01:57.280,0:01:58.960
them and then you can get in front of

0:01:58.640,0:02:02.159
them

0:01:58.960,0:02:02.960
you'll you'll learn that it takes a

0:02:02.159,0:02:05.119
little while

0:02:02.960,0:02:06.840
to get good at driving the sheepdog so

0:02:05.119,0:02:10.080
that was a demo now let's talk about

0:02:06.840,0:02:12.560
responsibilities so when the game starts

0:02:10.080,0:02:13.680
a few things had to happen right so one

0:02:12.560,0:02:16.400
thing that had to happen

0:02:13.680,0:02:16.720
is somebody has to make all the sheep

0:02:16.400,0:02:19.920
right

0:02:16.720,0:02:19.920
that's something that has to happen

0:02:20.239,0:02:23.280
also the dog has to move with the arrow

0:02:22.800,0:02:26.000
keys

0:02:23.280,0:02:26.560
uh that's something that has to happen

0:02:26.000,0:02:28.319
sheep

0:02:26.560,0:02:30.400
um if they're touching the dog they need

0:02:28.319,0:02:33.280
to move with the dog

0:02:30.400,0:02:35.280
uh sheep that are touching the pin have

0:02:33.280,0:02:38.239
to move with the pin

0:02:35.280,0:02:39.920
so i have to move into the pin um and

0:02:38.239,0:02:40.239
then at the end of the game there's also

0:02:39.920,0:02:42.400
this

0:02:40.239,0:02:43.920
fastest time so right now last time my

0:02:42.400,0:02:45.760
fastest time was 45

0:02:43.920,0:02:47.120
i'm going to see if i'm faster this time

0:02:45.760,0:02:48.560
not really behind him good so i'll get

0:02:47.120,0:02:50.959
behind him good

0:02:48.560,0:02:52.800
and there you can see that i got 39

0:02:50.959,0:02:54.560
seconds so the idea of this game

0:02:52.800,0:02:56.959
is you're trying to crawl them as fast

0:02:54.560,0:02:58.319
as you can and it keeps track of your

0:02:56.959,0:02:59.519
fastest time

0:02:58.319,0:03:02.640
by the way there's also a feature that

0:02:59.519,0:03:05.200
if spacebar resets the fastest time

0:03:02.640,0:03:06.000
so that's what the game is and our goal

0:03:05.200,0:03:08.400
this time

0:03:06.000,0:03:09.599
since it is it doesn't necessarily look

0:03:08.400,0:03:13.360
big yet but it's big

0:03:09.599,0:03:15.840
trust me it's big is to work on planning

0:03:13.360,0:03:17.599
so one of the big things for today uh

0:03:15.840,0:03:18.000
that we want to do is we want you to be

0:03:17.599,0:03:20.319
able to

0:03:18.000,0:03:21.599
think about a plan so really when you're

0:03:20.319,0:03:22.959
making games on your own you just kind

0:03:21.599,0:03:24.959
of come up with ideas

0:03:22.959,0:03:27.360
um but what you need to do is you kind

0:03:24.959,0:03:29.599
of need to get out a pencil and paper

0:03:27.360,0:03:31.760
and just kind of like plan who's going

0:03:29.599,0:03:33.519
to be responsible for what

0:03:31.760,0:03:35.440
so we're going to do that with our

0:03:33.519,0:03:36.799
campers together

0:03:35.440,0:03:39.200
so we're going to try to come up with

0:03:36.799,0:03:41.360
what are some of the different tasks

0:03:39.200,0:03:42.239
that we need to do in this game and then

0:03:41.360,0:03:44.159
which sprite

0:03:42.239,0:03:45.360
is going to be responsible for it i'm

0:03:44.159,0:03:47.440
going to move the camera over to where

0:03:45.360,0:03:50.239
you can see this projector better

0:03:47.440,0:03:51.840
all right so um obviously these are

0:03:50.239,0:03:53.599
slides so i can only like go in

0:03:51.840,0:03:55.599
in some order but i'm going to ask my

0:03:53.599,0:03:57.200
campers um what are some things that

0:03:55.599,0:03:58.840
that need to happen what are some tasks

0:03:57.200,0:04:02.319
that need to happen this game

0:03:58.840,0:04:04.000
keegan need to create 10 sheep uh that's

0:04:02.319,0:04:06.560
a good one so i'm gonna go ahead and go

0:04:04.000,0:04:07.439
uh to that one um you got you got one

0:04:06.560,0:04:08.799
for free so

0:04:07.439,0:04:10.720
i had started timer is something that

0:04:08.799,0:04:11.519
needs to happen so we need to create ten

0:04:10.720,0:04:13.280
sheep

0:04:11.519,0:04:15.200
um these ten sheep are all going to be

0:04:13.280,0:04:15.920
clones so i could have written on the

0:04:15.200,0:04:18.560
word

0:04:15.920,0:04:19.759
clones on here because there's only one

0:04:18.560,0:04:21.280
sheep sprite

0:04:19.759,0:04:23.360
also i'm going to add one more on here

0:04:21.280,0:04:25.040
for what keegan said these sheep

0:04:23.360,0:04:27.199
i don't know if you noticed but they're

0:04:25.040,0:04:29.440
randomly put on there but in places that

0:04:27.199,0:04:30.400
are not touching the pen or the dog

0:04:29.440,0:04:31.440
because you don't want to start on the

0:04:30.400,0:04:32.880
dog and you definitely don't want to

0:04:31.440,0:04:33.919
start in the pen

0:04:32.880,0:04:36.400
so that's something that we're going to

0:04:33.919,0:04:38.000
do what's another task that we need to

0:04:36.400,0:04:40.400
do

0:04:38.000,0:04:41.199
mckinley have the dog move with the

0:04:40.400,0:04:42.639
arrow keys

0:04:41.199,0:04:44.160
have the dog move the arrow keys that's

0:04:42.639,0:04:44.880
that's a great one i don't know what's

0:04:44.160,0:04:47.280
next

0:04:44.880,0:04:49.680
uh oh awesome you you locked right into

0:04:47.280,0:04:50.639
it so the dog needs to move using the

0:04:49.680,0:04:54.000
arrow keys

0:04:50.639,0:04:55.600
um so he's got the up uh the down

0:04:54.000,0:04:57.600
uh and then the left and the right so

0:04:55.600,0:05:01.120
we're gonna have to do those things

0:04:57.600,0:05:01.120
uh what other things have to happen

0:05:01.520,0:05:06.400
keegan you need to make a sound you need

0:05:04.479,0:05:07.120
to make a sound so like whenever the

0:05:06.400,0:05:08.960
sheep

0:05:07.120,0:05:10.639
uh get put into the pen you have to make

0:05:08.960,0:05:12.160
a sound that's a little lower on my list

0:05:10.639,0:05:13.360
someone asked mckinley for one

0:05:12.160,0:05:15.759
mckimley what's another thing you have

0:05:13.360,0:05:18.400
to do um

0:05:15.759,0:05:19.199
whenever you're touching the sheet in

0:05:18.400,0:05:22.560
the back

0:05:19.199,0:05:23.520
you can move them okay so what she said

0:05:22.560,0:05:27.039
was she said

0:05:23.520,0:05:29.039
um when you're touching a sheep with the

0:05:27.039,0:05:31.919
dog they have to also move right so

0:05:29.039,0:05:32.800
sheep touching the dog will move with

0:05:31.919,0:05:34.639
the dog

0:05:32.800,0:05:36.400
and then the one keegan said was

0:05:34.639,0:05:38.479
basically sheep touching the pen

0:05:36.400,0:05:39.680
are moved into the pen right so there's

0:05:38.479,0:05:41.919
there's a couple things that have to

0:05:39.680,0:05:43.520
happen there

0:05:41.919,0:05:44.720
um other things that have to happen i'll

0:05:43.520,0:05:46.160
just kind of throw these last couple you

0:05:44.720,0:05:47.759
guys did great thank you very much

0:05:46.160,0:05:49.440
um we're gonna have to track the number

0:05:47.759,0:05:50.800
of sheep that are in the pin

0:05:49.440,0:05:52.479
um and then we're gonna have to like

0:05:50.800,0:05:54.000
know when the game ends

0:05:52.479,0:05:55.680
and then you can't see this but there's

0:05:54.000,0:05:58.000
some like game over like check

0:05:55.680,0:05:59.840
for the fastest time now the next

0:05:58.000,0:06:00.720
question who's responsible for these

0:05:59.840,0:06:04.240
things

0:06:00.720,0:06:08.160
now obviously we've got a dog

0:06:04.240,0:06:09.600
we've got a sheep uh we've got a pen

0:06:08.160,0:06:12.400
um and then we've also got the

0:06:09.600,0:06:15.280
background or the stage

0:06:12.400,0:06:16.240
and so those are the the three sprites

0:06:15.280,0:06:17.520
that we're gonna have

0:06:16.240,0:06:20.000
and then you've also always got the

0:06:17.520,0:06:21.199
background so who's going to start the

0:06:20.000,0:06:22.319
timer so who do you think is going to

0:06:21.199,0:06:25.280
reset the timer

0:06:22.319,0:06:26.639
keegan yeah so you can actually do this

0:06:25.280,0:06:28.000
on either it could be done by the

0:06:26.639,0:06:30.000
backdrop

0:06:28.000,0:06:31.280
or you could do it with the dog uh

0:06:30.000,0:06:32.840
either would work

0:06:31.280,0:06:34.880
who's going to create the 10 sheep

0:06:32.840,0:06:37.360
mckinley the backdrop

0:06:34.880,0:06:38.639
the backdrop yep and now i'm gonna i'm

0:06:37.360,0:06:41.919
gonna cheat a little bit

0:06:38.639,0:06:44.960
this game is pretty big i'm gonna

0:06:41.919,0:06:47.280
choose this is a voluntary choice to

0:06:44.960,0:06:48.080
um do these things that could happen on

0:06:47.280,0:06:49.280
the backdrop

0:06:48.080,0:06:52.319
i'm going to choose to do them on the

0:06:49.280,0:06:53.120
dog just so that i have no code on the

0:06:52.319,0:06:54.639
backdrop

0:06:53.120,0:06:55.759
that may not be the greatest choice in

0:06:54.639,0:06:57.039
the world but that's how i'm going to do

0:06:55.759,0:06:59.280
it and you're stuck

0:06:57.039,0:07:00.840
with the way i do things right so we're

0:06:59.280,0:07:02.080
going to choose to just do them on the

0:07:00.840,0:07:04.639
dog

0:07:02.080,0:07:05.840
and then this creation of the sheep that

0:07:04.639,0:07:08.400
aren't touching the pen

0:07:05.840,0:07:09.680
this is going to be the job of the sheep

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.039
by the way the sheep are actually going

0:07:09.680,0:07:12.400
to be involved with the creation of

0:07:11.039,0:07:14.560
sheep as well right because they have to

0:07:12.400,0:07:16.160
have a little bit of code

0:07:14.560,0:07:17.680
dog moves with the arrow key who does

0:07:16.160,0:07:20.880
that dog

0:07:17.680,0:07:24.560
dog so that one's right um the sheep

0:07:20.880,0:07:24.560
will move with the dog who does that

0:07:25.680,0:07:30.800
that's actually a combo so it's a it's a

0:07:27.840,0:07:32.560
dog and the sheep combo right

0:07:30.800,0:07:34.080
sheep touching the pen moved into the

0:07:32.560,0:07:35.520
pen

0:07:34.080,0:07:38.319
that's the sheep and then it also

0:07:35.520,0:07:41.280
involves the pen right

0:07:38.319,0:07:42.479
uh and then there's some um tracking of

0:07:41.280,0:07:44.160
the sheep in the pen who do you think's

0:07:42.479,0:07:48.240
gonna do that though

0:07:44.160,0:07:50.000
yeah so the pen plus the sheep

0:07:48.240,0:07:52.160
um and then the game over stuff i'm just

0:07:50.000,0:07:55.520
gonna all do with the dog

0:07:52.160,0:07:57.759
um so this is my this is my plan

0:07:55.520,0:07:58.800
i could say that with the slides a

0:07:57.759,0:08:00.560
little cleaner

0:07:58.800,0:08:02.479
uh so i mean i think that maybe it looks

0:08:00.560,0:08:04.560
cleaner on the slides

0:08:02.479,0:08:06.639
i always like this game but you cover up

0:08:04.560,0:08:09.120
your whiteboard uh with this

0:08:06.639,0:08:10.240
so each of these responsibilities uh is

0:08:09.120,0:08:13.599
going to happen

0:08:10.240,0:08:14.960
by one of our sprites right and then if

0:08:13.599,0:08:17.440
i were to take this list

0:08:14.960,0:08:18.560
uh and rearrange it by by whose

0:08:17.440,0:08:20.000
responsibilities

0:08:18.560,0:08:22.000
everything was there's certain

0:08:20.000,0:08:24.479
responsibilities for the sheep

0:08:22.000,0:08:26.160
so this is what the sheep needs to do uh

0:08:24.479,0:08:29.440
there's certain responsibilities

0:08:26.160,0:08:31.680
uh for the pen um and then there's

0:08:29.440,0:08:33.440
certain responsibilities for the dog

0:08:31.680,0:08:35.120
so it's gonna be kind of complex i'm

0:08:33.440,0:08:37.279
gonna move the camera back over

0:08:35.120,0:08:39.599
uh and so we'll actually refer to this

0:08:37.279,0:08:41.919
plan uh as we build our game

0:08:39.599,0:08:43.200
um and we're gonna start somewhere uh

0:08:41.919,0:08:45.440
we're actually gonna start

0:08:43.200,0:08:47.279
with um i'm gonna give you some some

0:08:45.440,0:08:48.800
images uh here in just a second

0:08:47.279,0:08:50.480
and we're gonna start by implementing

0:08:48.800,0:08:52.399
things on the dog

0:08:50.480,0:08:53.519
now the dog actually i'll say has a

0:08:52.399,0:08:55.279
couple things he's got

0:08:53.519,0:08:57.279
kind of some initialization things that

0:08:55.279,0:08:58.800
happen uh and then he's got some

0:08:57.279,0:09:00.320
movement things that happen

0:08:58.800,0:09:02.160
and then he's got some game over things

0:09:00.320,0:09:03.839
that happen those three categories

0:09:02.160,0:09:06.240
we're actually going to break down for

0:09:03.839,0:09:07.120
the dog so to get started with this what

0:09:06.240,0:09:10.160
i need you to do

0:09:07.120,0:09:12.880
is i need you to remix

0:09:10.160,0:09:14.160
a scratch project that i made for you

0:09:12.880,0:09:16.080
the link

0:09:14.160,0:09:19.360
that you need to go to is is right here

0:09:16.080,0:09:21.200
so it's scratch.mit.edu projects and

0:09:19.360,0:09:24.959
then you can see this is the number

0:09:21.200,0:09:27.519
i'll put this number in the email

0:09:24.959,0:09:28.240
i'll put this number in the video just

0:09:27.519,0:09:30.800
below

0:09:28.240,0:09:32.040
this youtube video also put this number

0:09:30.800,0:09:33.440
on the main camp page so

0:09:32.040,0:09:36.080
connectingwithcode.org

0:09:33.440,0:09:37.440
camp if all those things failed you can

0:09:36.080,0:09:38.880
always type it

0:09:37.440,0:09:40.480
and essentially what you need to do is

0:09:38.880,0:09:41.600
you need to go to this webpage so here

0:09:40.480,0:09:43.200
i'm on this webpage

0:09:41.600,0:09:46.240
and then you need to click on the word

0:09:43.200,0:09:47.920
remix so if you click on the word remix

0:09:46.240,0:09:50.160
it will actually make a copy of this

0:09:47.920,0:09:52.320
project and put it over in your area

0:09:50.160,0:09:54.000
and it will name it irish sheepdog

0:09:52.320,0:09:55.120
starting code remix

0:09:54.000,0:09:56.959
what i'm going to choose to do is i'm

0:09:55.120,0:09:58.320
going to take off the word starting code

0:09:56.959,0:10:01.760
remix

0:09:58.320,0:10:02.959
because this is my irish sheepdog

0:10:01.760,0:10:05.200
so that's what i'm going to save this

0:10:02.959,0:10:06.399
project as all right so whenever i get

0:10:05.200,0:10:08.399
starting code

0:10:06.399,0:10:09.839
from someone i always like to take a

0:10:08.399,0:10:11.600
minute and see

0:10:09.839,0:10:13.360
what all is there right what am i

0:10:11.600,0:10:14.880
looking at so you can see that i've got

0:10:13.360,0:10:15.760
a couple different sprites i've got a

0:10:14.880,0:10:18.640
sheep sprite

0:10:15.760,0:10:20.079
so here's my sheep i've got a sheep dog

0:10:18.640,0:10:22.880
sprite

0:10:20.079,0:10:24.000
and then i've got a pen and also i've

0:10:22.880,0:10:25.600
got a backdrop

0:10:24.000,0:10:27.920
by the way these are all just kind of

0:10:25.600,0:10:29.360
custom images which is why it was easier

0:10:27.920,0:10:30.320
to remix than to let you find these

0:10:29.360,0:10:31.839
things

0:10:30.320,0:10:33.279
if you go look at the costumes you can

0:10:31.839,0:10:34.880
see there's only one costume for the

0:10:33.279,0:10:38.000
sheep that's pretty simple

0:10:34.880,0:10:39.200
the dog was actually an animated gif so

0:10:38.000,0:10:43.519
he actually has

0:10:39.200,0:10:44.800
um literally like 141 costumes

0:10:43.519,0:10:48.000
and it'll make him look like he's

0:10:44.800,0:10:49.760
barking so it's an animated gif file

0:10:48.000,0:10:51.120
and then the pen i did something super

0:10:49.760,0:10:54.800
sneaky for the pen

0:10:51.120,0:10:58.240
the pen actually is a costume

0:10:54.800,0:11:01.040
that has various sheep in it right so

0:10:58.240,0:11:02.160
it's kind of funny costume one has zero

0:11:01.040,0:11:04.640
sheep

0:11:02.160,0:11:05.440
costume two has one sheep custom three

0:11:04.640,0:11:07.040
has two sheep

0:11:05.440,0:11:08.880
and so actually what we're gonna do is

0:11:07.040,0:11:11.200
whenever they uh get put

0:11:08.880,0:11:12.399
into the pin really we're gonna delete

0:11:11.200,0:11:13.920
the clone

0:11:12.399,0:11:16.240
and we're gonna switch the costume on

0:11:13.920,0:11:19.600
the pen sneaky isn't it

0:11:16.240,0:11:22.079
yeah very sneaky all right so uh let's

0:11:19.600,0:11:25.040
let's dive in and start coding we're

0:11:22.079,0:11:28.399
going to start in uh with the dog

0:11:25.040,0:11:31.519
and so the dog some

0:11:28.399,0:11:32.399
initialized tasks he's got some movement

0:11:31.519,0:11:33.760
tasks

0:11:32.399,0:11:35.440
and then he's got some like check for

0:11:33.760,0:11:36.800
game over task

0:11:35.440,0:11:38.160
and one thing you can do when you're

0:11:36.800,0:11:39.440
planning your code is you can use

0:11:38.160,0:11:42.160
functions

0:11:39.440,0:11:43.200
just to organize complex things so what

0:11:42.160,0:11:45.120
we're going to do is we're going to make

0:11:43.200,0:11:48.240
these three functions initialize

0:11:45.120,0:11:49.760
move and check for game over and you can

0:11:48.240,0:11:51.120
see that this is what the dog does he

0:11:49.760,0:11:52.959
initializes once

0:11:51.120,0:11:54.639
and then he forever moves and checks her

0:11:52.959,0:11:58.000
game over so let's go ahead

0:11:54.639,0:12:01.519
and go into the code for the dog

0:11:58.000,0:12:03.440
let's grab a win green flag clicked

0:12:01.519,0:12:04.800
and then to keep ourselves organized

0:12:03.440,0:12:05.360
because we've got a big game here we're

0:12:04.800,0:12:08.079
going to use

0:12:05.360,0:12:10.160
functions i have to stay organized the

0:12:08.079,0:12:12.880
first function is going to be called

0:12:10.160,0:12:15.120
initialize i'm going to go and type the

0:12:12.880,0:12:18.320
whole the whole thing here

0:12:15.120,0:12:20.160
so you create the function initialize uh

0:12:18.320,0:12:21.360
and then we'll stick on the initialize

0:12:20.160,0:12:23.279
block

0:12:21.360,0:12:24.639
initialize is of course hard to spell i

0:12:23.279,0:12:25.839
think i got it right i had to go help

0:12:24.639,0:12:27.760
keegan

0:12:25.839,0:12:30.720
after initialize i also want to make a

0:12:27.760,0:12:33.760
block called move

0:12:30.720,0:12:35.200
and so move is going to happen inside a

0:12:33.760,0:12:36.079
forever loop

0:12:35.200,0:12:40.240
so i'm going to go ahead and go to

0:12:36.079,0:12:42.000
control and say forever

0:12:40.240,0:12:44.160
and then i'm going to stick on my move

0:12:42.000,0:12:46.000
block in there

0:12:44.160,0:12:47.279
and then the last function we're going

0:12:46.000,0:12:51.360
to use is

0:12:47.279,0:12:53.279
check for game over

0:12:51.360,0:12:55.040
of a long one to type there so check for

0:12:53.279,0:12:56.480
game over by the way if you ever need to

0:12:55.040,0:12:58.160
pause the video because it takes you

0:12:56.480,0:13:00.959
longer to type than it takes me to type

0:12:58.160,0:13:02.560
that's totally fine just pause the video

0:13:00.959,0:13:04.079
no big deal

0:13:02.560,0:13:07.360
and we've got these these three

0:13:04.079,0:13:10.320
functions check for game over

0:13:07.360,0:13:12.399
so the code so far doesn't do anything

0:13:10.320,0:13:14.560
it's simply

0:13:12.399,0:13:16.240
getting some planning together i'm gonna

0:13:14.560,0:13:17.600
do check for game over last so i'm just

0:13:16.240,0:13:18.639
gonna kind of like set it over here out

0:13:17.600,0:13:20.240
of the way

0:13:18.639,0:13:22.000
but this initialize and move we're going

0:13:20.240,0:13:24.079
to do pretty early

0:13:22.000,0:13:25.519
so what are some things that the dog

0:13:24.079,0:13:27.920
needs to do

0:13:25.519,0:13:30.399
during the initialize thing and this is

0:13:27.920,0:13:34.000
where plans are really useful

0:13:30.399,0:13:36.000
he needs to start a timer

0:13:34.000,0:13:37.600
all right so so part of this is he needs

0:13:36.000,0:13:39.680
to start a timer

0:13:37.600,0:13:41.760
there's also some things that i realize

0:13:39.680,0:13:42.880
now should have been in my plan that

0:13:41.760,0:13:45.120
weren't there

0:13:42.880,0:13:46.160
and that's fine i just add them for

0:13:45.120,0:13:47.680
example

0:13:46.160,0:13:49.600
i never said in my plan that i should

0:13:47.680,0:13:51.199
set the dog's starting position

0:13:49.600,0:13:52.240
well i would like for him to start i'm

0:13:51.199,0:13:53.040
just going to make him start in the

0:13:52.240,0:13:54.720
corner

0:13:53.040,0:13:56.639
um there's a good spot that he can kind

0:13:54.720,0:13:58.320
of start over here and that wasn't in my

0:13:56.639,0:14:00.240
plan but i've got to do it

0:13:58.320,0:14:02.560
so i'm actually going to put him where i

0:14:00.240,0:14:04.240
want him to start and then i'm going to

0:14:02.560,0:14:07.040
go to motion and i'm going to say

0:14:04.240,0:14:08.800
go to xy that's going to be part of

0:14:07.040,0:14:09.920
initialize

0:14:08.800,0:14:12.399
and then i'm going to go ahead and also

0:14:09.920,0:14:14.160
put on this point in direction 90. so he

0:14:12.399,0:14:15.680
points in direction 90.

0:14:14.160,0:14:17.440
so just to make sure that my code's

0:14:15.680,0:14:19.360
working if i put him somewhere different

0:14:17.440,0:14:21.040
when i hit the green flag he should snap

0:14:19.360,0:14:23.600
to that starting position

0:14:21.040,0:14:25.199
so um the code doesn't do much yet but

0:14:23.600,0:14:26.880
it does work

0:14:25.199,0:14:28.399
it's kind of nice that you can just make

0:14:26.880,0:14:29.760
these dummy functions

0:14:28.399,0:14:31.600
it's just kind of like placeholders for

0:14:29.760,0:14:32.800
your planning but we haven't actually

0:14:31.600,0:14:34.000
used them yet

0:14:32.800,0:14:36.000
all right so the thing that it's said to

0:14:34.000,0:14:37.519
do is start a timer there's actually a

0:14:36.000,0:14:40.639
built-in timer

0:14:37.519,0:14:42.800
it's in sensing and so the timer is

0:14:40.639,0:14:44.720
actually like a magical built-in thing

0:14:42.800,0:14:46.160
and so the only thing we need to do uh

0:14:44.720,0:14:49.760
to start the timer

0:14:46.160,0:14:51.040
is we need this function reset timer

0:14:49.760,0:14:52.240
so that's literally the only thing we

0:14:51.040,0:14:54.000
need to do i'll make my screen just a

0:14:52.240,0:14:56.959
little bigger for you here

0:14:54.000,0:14:57.519
uh so reset timer uh we'll we'll do that

0:14:56.959,0:14:59.760
task

0:14:57.519,0:15:01.519
and so like if i was marking them off i

0:14:59.760,0:15:02.480
would just mark that line off that one's

0:15:01.519,0:15:04.000
done

0:15:02.480,0:15:06.320
uh the next thing i need to do is i need

0:15:04.000,0:15:08.160
to create 10 sheep

0:15:06.320,0:15:10.240
so i'm going to use cloning to my

0:15:08.160,0:15:12.480
advantage here

0:15:10.240,0:15:13.920
so i'm going to go to uh control and

0:15:12.480,0:15:17.120
make a loop

0:15:13.920,0:15:18.639
that goes 10 times obviously we could

0:15:17.120,0:15:19.199
put 10 of them in a row but we just want

0:15:18.639,0:15:21.839
a loop

0:15:19.199,0:15:22.720
that does it and what i want to do is i

0:15:21.839,0:15:27.839
want to

0:15:22.720,0:15:27.839
create a clone of sheep

0:15:27.920,0:15:32.959
if i were to run this now it would look

0:15:29.839,0:15:36.320
like nothing happened so if i run it now

0:15:32.959,0:15:38.720
it it worked it created 10 sheep

0:15:36.320,0:15:40.079
the original is still there so there's

0:15:38.720,0:15:42.240
actually 11 sheep

0:15:40.079,0:15:44.560
uh if i were to move them all out there

0:15:42.240,0:15:46.639
should be 11 sheep in there

0:15:44.560,0:15:49.279
so obviously it worked but it wasn't

0:15:46.639,0:15:50.880
what i wanted to have happen right

0:15:49.279,0:15:52.800
so what i want to happen is i want to

0:15:50.880,0:15:54.959
create 10 sheep but i want the sheep to

0:15:52.800,0:15:58.240
go to random positions

0:15:54.959,0:16:01.839
that responsibility is actually not

0:15:58.240,0:16:04.320
on the dog that responsibility

0:16:01.839,0:16:06.000
is going to be on the the sheep right so

0:16:04.320,0:16:07.839
not touching the pen or the dog so

0:16:06.000,0:16:08.160
they're going to be in a random position

0:16:07.839,0:16:10.399
uh

0:16:08.160,0:16:12.399
not touching the sheep of the dog so go

0:16:10.399,0:16:13.759
into the sheep

0:16:12.399,0:16:16.399
we're going to be bouncing around

0:16:13.759,0:16:17.680
sprites for a long time so just kind of

0:16:16.399,0:16:18.959
expect that we're just kind of like

0:16:17.680,0:16:20.240
we're in the dog for a second we're in

0:16:18.959,0:16:22.399
the sheep for a second we're in the pen

0:16:20.240,0:16:25.519
for a second you get the idea

0:16:22.399,0:16:28.800
in the sheep so the sheep need

0:16:25.519,0:16:32.000
when i start as cloned so sheep

0:16:28.800,0:16:32.959
start as clone the first thing that you

0:16:32.000,0:16:35.440
want sheep to do

0:16:32.959,0:16:36.880
is you want them to show up because

0:16:35.440,0:16:38.720
we're going to hide the original we've

0:16:36.880,0:16:41.920
done this trick a few times

0:16:38.720,0:16:44.240
so i want them to show up and i want

0:16:41.920,0:16:47.440
them to be in a random position

0:16:44.240,0:16:51.040
so i'm going to go to motion

0:16:47.440,0:16:53.680
and say go to random position

0:16:51.040,0:16:55.120
now if i start the game again it goes

0:16:53.680,0:16:57.519
much better

0:16:55.120,0:16:58.959
if you were to actually count the sheep

0:16:57.519,0:17:00.639
there would be 11 of them

0:16:58.959,0:17:02.320
because we haven't hidden the original

0:17:00.639,0:17:05.120
yet so i'm going to

0:17:02.320,0:17:06.480
stop the game i'm going to find the

0:17:05.120,0:17:08.720
original and i'm going to hide the

0:17:06.480,0:17:10.640
original

0:17:08.720,0:17:13.280
and so now when i run it there should

0:17:10.640,0:17:15.039
actually be 10 sheep

0:17:13.280,0:17:16.959
now the next thing i want to do is i

0:17:15.039,0:17:19.120
want to point out a problem

0:17:16.959,0:17:21.679
oh the mine's a perfect example notice

0:17:19.120,0:17:24.160
where one of my sheep randomly started

0:17:21.679,0:17:25.280
i had a sheep that randomly started

0:17:24.160,0:17:28.319
right in the pen

0:17:25.280,0:17:29.600
right um and that we could make that

0:17:28.319,0:17:30.720
work but that's not what i want to do

0:17:29.600,0:17:31.840
because i don't want to start with them

0:17:30.720,0:17:34.720
in the pen

0:17:31.840,0:17:35.760
likewise they might randomly start on

0:17:34.720,0:17:39.039
top of the dog

0:17:35.760,0:17:39.760
right that's not terrible but it's not

0:17:39.039,0:17:42.720
what i want

0:17:39.760,0:17:44.160
so i want to make sure that they don't

0:17:42.720,0:17:46.000
start on the dog

0:17:44.160,0:17:47.280
and that they don't start on the pen so

0:17:46.000,0:17:50.000
how do we do that

0:17:47.280,0:17:51.039
uh do you guys have any ideas if

0:17:50.000,0:17:52.880
statements

0:17:51.039,0:17:54.799
all right so mckinley said if statements

0:17:52.880,0:17:57.039
if statements uh would totally work

0:17:54.799,0:17:58.000
um but the thing is if we put an if

0:17:57.039,0:18:00.240
statement in here

0:17:58.000,0:18:01.280
it would check it once right so like we

0:18:00.240,0:18:04.240
could say if

0:18:01.280,0:18:05.760
uh you're on the pen or on the dog then

0:18:04.240,0:18:08.960
go to a new random position

0:18:05.760,0:18:10.720
uh mckinley you got an idea

0:18:08.960,0:18:12.160
yeah so an if statement in a forever

0:18:10.720,0:18:13.600
loop now

0:18:12.160,0:18:15.200
we don't want to go forever though

0:18:13.600,0:18:17.440
because we want to just keep picking new

0:18:15.200,0:18:18.880
random positions until

0:18:17.440,0:18:21.520
we're somewhere not touching the dog

0:18:18.880,0:18:23.919
does that make sense yeah

0:18:21.520,0:18:25.440
so yeah so there's a lot of good a lot

0:18:23.919,0:18:26.720
of good options i love that you guys are

0:18:25.440,0:18:29.919
just firing things out

0:18:26.720,0:18:32.720
we're going to use repeat and tell

0:18:29.919,0:18:35.039
so here's what we're going to do we're

0:18:32.720,0:18:37.760
going to

0:18:35.039,0:18:38.400
pick a random position and then we're

0:18:37.760,0:18:41.440
going to

0:18:38.400,0:18:45.280
repeat until we're not touching

0:18:41.440,0:18:47.360
the dog and we're not touching the pin

0:18:45.280,0:18:49.280
if we are if either of those things are

0:18:47.360,0:18:50.480
true then we're going to pick a new

0:18:49.280,0:18:52.240
random position

0:18:50.480,0:18:54.240
and then we'll check again right so

0:18:52.240,0:18:56.640
we're going to pick a random position

0:18:54.240,0:18:57.760
maybe it's fine if it's not we're gonna

0:18:56.640,0:18:59.760
pick a new one

0:18:57.760,0:19:02.480
until this condition is true now what

0:18:59.760,0:19:05.600
makes this hard is this condition

0:19:02.480,0:19:08.960
so it has to be not touching the dog

0:19:05.600,0:19:10.960
or the pen so how do we write uh this

0:19:08.960,0:19:13.600
this statement so we're going to repeat

0:19:10.960,0:19:15.919
until it's going to be complex

0:19:13.600,0:19:17.360
so one thing we're going to do is we're

0:19:15.919,0:19:20.559
going to have in here

0:19:17.360,0:19:25.520
a touching uh the dog

0:19:20.559,0:19:27.600
and a touching uh the pen

0:19:25.520,0:19:29.120
now we want to go and tell we're not

0:19:27.600,0:19:32.640
touching those things

0:19:29.120,0:19:36.080
so operators have knots so

0:19:32.640,0:19:39.600
not touching the sheep dog

0:19:36.080,0:19:40.400
not touching the pen so i want to repeat

0:19:39.600,0:19:43.679
until

0:19:40.400,0:19:45.200
i'm not touching him and i'm not

0:19:43.679,0:19:47.039
touching him right

0:19:45.200,0:19:48.320
so there's an and statement in here so

0:19:47.039,0:19:50.240
this thing

0:19:48.320,0:19:51.919
it's subtle but it gets really big

0:19:50.240,0:19:53.200
really quick right now you have to be

0:19:51.919,0:19:55.360
careful when you drag these things in

0:19:53.200,0:19:56.960
make sure you grab it like from the knot

0:19:55.360,0:20:00.240
um and so this is like

0:19:56.960,0:20:01.679
the biggest if statement ever right um

0:20:00.240,0:20:04.400
it's so big that i can't even like see

0:20:01.679,0:20:07.840
the whole thing so repeat until

0:20:04.400,0:20:09.600
i'm not touching the sheepdog and

0:20:07.840,0:20:10.880
i'm not touching the pen it's actually

0:20:09.600,0:20:12.159
quite readable

0:20:10.880,0:20:13.760
the hardest part is actually like

0:20:12.159,0:20:14.159
getting it situated to where it goes in

0:20:13.760,0:20:16.000
here

0:20:14.159,0:20:18.799
remember that you like put the tip of it

0:20:16.000,0:20:21.679
in there and it goes white

0:20:18.799,0:20:22.720
so we test your uh your code dexterity

0:20:21.679,0:20:24.799
skills there

0:20:22.720,0:20:26.799
um to see if you can make that line of

0:20:24.799,0:20:29.360
code so you can see that this time

0:20:26.799,0:20:30.320
a sheep started right on me but now with

0:20:29.360,0:20:33.280
my new revised

0:20:30.320,0:20:34.000
code uh it should not happen it looks

0:20:33.280,0:20:36.400
like it happened

0:20:34.000,0:20:37.520
why did it happen um must have goofed

0:20:36.400,0:20:38.960
something up

0:20:37.520,0:20:40.720
they started the pen so i goofed

0:20:38.960,0:20:41.840
something up

0:20:40.720,0:20:43.360
all right so what did i do wrong i

0:20:41.840,0:20:44.080
actually i noticed what i did wrong uh

0:20:43.360,0:20:45.919
almost right away

0:20:44.080,0:20:47.280
my show is at the bottom the problem

0:20:45.919,0:20:48.640
with having show at the bottom is it's

0:20:47.280,0:20:50.159
invisible right there's no way to be

0:20:48.640,0:20:52.640
touching something when you're invisible

0:20:50.159,0:20:53.760
so you actually need the show this time

0:20:52.640,0:20:55.679
to be at the top

0:20:53.760,0:20:57.360
technically it could be here or here it

0:20:55.679,0:20:58.960
doesn't really matter

0:20:57.360,0:21:00.720
i'll put it put it right here just to

0:20:58.960,0:21:03.280
prove that i understand how it works

0:21:00.720,0:21:04.400
so now when you run it they never show

0:21:03.280,0:21:06.799
up whoa he's

0:21:04.400,0:21:08.559
he showed up above the dog just barely

0:21:06.799,0:21:10.640
snuck in there right

0:21:08.559,0:21:13.679
another thing that mckinley did is she

0:21:10.640,0:21:17.679
added another and statement

0:21:13.679,0:21:20.400
and another sensor and she added a

0:21:17.679,0:21:22.080
um and not oh i should have done it the

0:21:20.400,0:21:25.760
way mckinley did it

0:21:22.080,0:21:27.919
and not touching edge as well

0:21:25.760,0:21:29.520
right so if you want to throw this in

0:21:27.919,0:21:30.799
you can because you'll notice that right

0:21:29.520,0:21:33.679
now they can show up like

0:21:30.799,0:21:34.720
half off the screen i think that seems

0:21:33.679,0:21:37.600
like a good thing to add

0:21:34.720,0:21:38.000
it makes it even more complicated right

0:21:37.600,0:21:41.200
so

0:21:38.000,0:21:42.559
i'm going to stick this whole and

0:21:41.200,0:21:44.320
i don't care if you do this or not this

0:21:42.559,0:21:45.919
is optional if you've got this working

0:21:44.320,0:21:48.159
feel free to move forwards if you want

0:21:45.919,0:21:50.799
to use sissy's fancy thing

0:21:48.159,0:21:52.799
she took this whole and and dropped it

0:21:50.799,0:21:56.480
into right there

0:21:52.799,0:21:59.120
and now she made a oh shoot i messed up

0:21:56.480,0:22:01.039
so now she grabbed a mega thing so i've

0:21:59.120,0:22:01.919
got to grab the right word and to move

0:22:01.039,0:22:04.559
it around

0:22:01.919,0:22:05.360
um and then there it is i told you it

0:22:04.559,0:22:07.440
was a hard day

0:22:05.360,0:22:09.200
i didn't uh i didn't hide that fact at

0:22:07.440,0:22:10.480
all maybe i'll get to where i can show

0:22:09.200,0:22:12.960
you more code

0:22:10.480,0:22:14.880
but now i've got sissy's solution so i'm

0:22:12.960,0:22:18.559
not touching the sheepdog

0:22:14.880,0:22:21.600
and not touching the pen and

0:22:18.559,0:22:23.520
not touching the edge um pretty easy to

0:22:21.600,0:22:26.400
read and review it's just hard to make

0:22:23.520,0:22:28.080
right so now let's see if sissy's

0:22:26.400,0:22:31.200
solution works so now i should never be

0:22:28.080,0:22:32.559
on the edge as well [ __ ] i love it good

0:22:31.200,0:22:36.640
call

0:22:32.559,0:22:38.640
all right so we are uh doing things uh

0:22:36.640,0:22:41.200
great we're knocking things off of our

0:22:38.640,0:22:43.840
list that's super

0:22:41.200,0:22:45.600
next what we probably ought to do is we

0:22:43.840,0:22:48.159
ought to

0:22:45.600,0:22:49.280
move the dog using the arrow keys i went

0:22:48.159,0:22:52.559
one slide too far

0:22:49.280,0:22:54.720
so initialization is in good shape

0:22:52.559,0:22:55.919
moving the dog using the arrow keys is

0:22:54.720,0:22:58.640
next

0:22:55.919,0:23:00.720
so i'm going to go back to the dogs code

0:22:58.640,0:23:01.520
so the dog's initialize is in is in

0:23:00.720,0:23:03.120
pretty good shape

0:23:01.520,0:23:04.799
uh i'm i'm okay with what's going on

0:23:03.120,0:23:06.559
there now i'm going to go over to the

0:23:04.799,0:23:09.200
dog's move area

0:23:06.559,0:23:09.679
the dog's move area is going to move

0:23:09.200,0:23:13.120
using

0:23:09.679,0:23:15.440
four different keys um up down left and

0:23:13.120,0:23:15.440
right

0:23:15.520,0:23:18.799
this does not need to be in a forever

0:23:17.840,0:23:20.320
loop because

0:23:18.799,0:23:22.320
over here we've already got a forever

0:23:20.320,0:23:23.600
loop right so we we just we just have if

0:23:22.320,0:23:25.520
statements over here

0:23:23.600,0:23:28.720
and so he's going to respond to the four

0:23:25.520,0:23:31.039
different keys so i'm going to have

0:23:28.720,0:23:34.240
a key for up down left and right so i'm

0:23:31.039,0:23:34.240
going to drag them all in

0:23:34.480,0:23:38.320
and then i'm going gonna switch them to

0:23:36.640,0:23:42.159
up

0:23:38.320,0:23:44.320
down left

0:23:42.159,0:23:46.960
uh and right uh and i'm gonna give my

0:23:44.320,0:23:48.960
campers just a minute to catch up

0:23:46.960,0:23:50.320
all right so let's move uh let's do the

0:23:48.960,0:23:52.320
movement with the arrow keys

0:23:50.320,0:23:54.240
so up arrow is going to move the dog

0:23:52.320,0:23:56.000
forward uh so we're going to move at

0:23:54.240,0:23:57.679
some speed

0:23:56.000,0:24:00.640
so i'm going to drag this move 10 in

0:23:57.679,0:24:02.880
there i could type in a number

0:24:00.640,0:24:04.400
for his speed that'd be fine but again

0:24:02.880,0:24:05.919
it's kind of like ground level in the

0:24:04.400,0:24:07.679
last app it's a variable that we're

0:24:05.919,0:24:09.600
going to use in various places

0:24:07.679,0:24:11.120
so i'm going to actually make a variable

0:24:09.600,0:24:13.200
called dog speed

0:24:11.120,0:24:14.480
i'm going to set it in initials and

0:24:13.200,0:24:17.360
initialize

0:24:14.480,0:24:19.039
so go to variables click on make a

0:24:17.360,0:24:20.960
variable

0:24:19.039,0:24:22.480
we want this to be available for all

0:24:20.960,0:24:24.480
sprites because we want the sheep to

0:24:22.480,0:24:25.840
know the dog speed as well

0:24:24.480,0:24:28.320
i'm going to type it like this i'm going

0:24:25.840,0:24:29.760
to type dog speed

0:24:28.320,0:24:32.400
again that's just how i like to do

0:24:29.760,0:24:34.000
variables so it's two words

0:24:32.400,0:24:37.440
it's smooshed together it's called camel

0:24:34.000,0:24:40.159
case so i've got dog speed

0:24:37.440,0:24:41.520
so i make the variable first the next

0:24:40.159,0:24:42.400
thing i want to do is i want to set the

0:24:41.520,0:24:43.760
variable

0:24:42.400,0:24:45.760
i don't care where you set it and

0:24:43.760,0:24:48.080
initialize it does not matter at all

0:24:45.760,0:24:50.799
i'm going to set it right at the top i'm

0:24:48.080,0:24:52.640
going to set my dog speed to 3.

0:24:50.799,0:24:54.320
i like doing this because if you use

0:24:52.640,0:24:55.600
this variable in multiple places and you

0:24:54.320,0:24:57.679
decide to change it you're going to

0:24:55.600,0:24:59.679
only need to change it right here it's a

0:24:57.679,0:25:02.400
really great way to do code

0:24:59.679,0:25:04.000
and so over here i'm going to move at

0:25:02.400,0:25:05.440
dog speed

0:25:04.000,0:25:06.960
by the way i don't really need to show

0:25:05.440,0:25:07.679
it on the screen so i'm just going to

0:25:06.960,0:25:09.919
hide it

0:25:07.679,0:25:11.120
so it's not visible there but what up

0:25:09.919,0:25:12.480
arrow is going to do is going to move at

0:25:11.120,0:25:13.520
dog speed so you can actually play your

0:25:12.480,0:25:15.039
game now

0:25:13.520,0:25:17.440
and when you hit up arrow your dog

0:25:15.039,0:25:18.799
should move at dog speed

0:25:17.440,0:25:22.240
and if you want him faster you can make

0:25:18.799,0:25:22.240
him faster but three is good enough

0:25:22.320,0:25:27.039
down arrow is going to move in the

0:25:25.279,0:25:29.200
negative direction

0:25:27.039,0:25:31.360
so i'm going to go into motion i'm going

0:25:29.200,0:25:34.320
to say move

0:25:31.360,0:25:35.360
and then he's going to move in negative

0:25:34.320,0:25:37.840
dog speed

0:25:35.360,0:25:40.480
now this one i don't care if you want to

0:25:37.840,0:25:42.080
just type in negative 3 i'm ok with that

0:25:40.480,0:25:44.480
but if you wanted to actually do it like

0:25:42.080,0:25:48.080
the elegant way you would use

0:25:44.480,0:25:50.880
multiplication um and you would use

0:25:48.080,0:25:51.760
the variable dog speed again and you

0:25:50.880,0:25:54.960
move it

0:25:51.760,0:25:56.640
negative one times dog speed right

0:25:54.960,0:25:57.679
so that's like the elegant way to do it

0:25:56.640,0:25:58.480
because you actually get to use your

0:25:57.679,0:26:00.640
variable again

0:25:58.480,0:26:03.039
so now i can go forwards uh with up

0:26:00.640,0:26:04.159
arrow uh and then i can go backwards

0:26:03.039,0:26:06.080
with down arrow

0:26:04.159,0:26:07.360
because he's moving at negative dog

0:26:06.080,0:26:11.440
speed right

0:26:07.360,0:26:14.000
kind of fun uh left and right arrows

0:26:11.440,0:26:15.440
are going to be turns so let's go ahead

0:26:14.000,0:26:17.679
and figure out which is which so

0:26:15.440,0:26:18.880
turning left is this one because that's

0:26:17.679,0:26:22.480
going to be kind of like a

0:26:18.880,0:26:25.200
left turn i'm going to be a little lazy

0:26:22.480,0:26:26.480
i'm just going to type a 5 in here and

0:26:25.200,0:26:29.200
then the other one

0:26:26.480,0:26:30.799
is going to be a 5 there again if i was

0:26:29.200,0:26:32.480
like trying to be really elegant with my

0:26:30.799,0:26:33.120
code i'd make a variable for that as

0:26:32.480,0:26:34.480
well

0:26:33.120,0:26:36.320
but i think that i'm going to cheat a

0:26:34.480,0:26:38.559
little bit here because this app

0:26:36.320,0:26:39.919
is is quite long so now i go forwards

0:26:38.559,0:26:44.000
and backwards

0:26:39.919,0:26:45.279
and then i can also go right uh and left

0:26:44.000,0:26:46.799
and take a minute and just kind of

0:26:45.279,0:26:48.480
practice with your dog right because you

0:26:46.799,0:26:49.679
need to be able to like drive them into

0:26:48.480,0:26:51.279
the pen

0:26:49.679,0:26:54.320
and then what i typically do is i back

0:26:51.279,0:26:55.279
up and then i like drive these guys into

0:26:54.320,0:26:57.279
the pen

0:26:55.279,0:27:00.000
um and then i kind of back up behind

0:26:57.279,0:27:01.840
them and then drive one and getting good

0:27:00.000,0:27:03.120
at your own game is fun

0:27:01.840,0:27:05.279
because then you'll be able to get the

0:27:03.120,0:27:08.080
fastest time so driving things

0:27:05.279,0:27:10.000
into the pen so i'm pretty happy with

0:27:08.080,0:27:12.559
the dog movements

0:27:10.000,0:27:13.600
so i would call that a check mark on

0:27:12.559,0:27:17.520
that

0:27:13.600,0:27:19.919
so dog moves using arrow keys is done

0:27:17.520,0:27:20.799
next thing we want to do is we want the

0:27:19.919,0:27:23.520
sheep

0:27:20.799,0:27:24.480
that are touching the dog to move with

0:27:23.520,0:27:27.520
the dog

0:27:24.480,0:27:29.360
this is is a little sneaky as well so

0:27:27.520,0:27:31.520
the sheep have to move with me

0:27:29.360,0:27:34.080
so we've never done anything like this

0:27:31.520,0:27:36.000
in a game before how do we do that so

0:27:34.080,0:27:38.399
essentially right here the dog moved

0:27:36.000,0:27:39.919
right so he moved at 10 steps

0:27:38.399,0:27:41.919
and what he really needs to do is he

0:27:39.919,0:27:44.880
needs to tell everybody else

0:27:41.919,0:27:45.360
that he's moving and then if they want

0:27:44.880,0:27:47.840
to move

0:27:45.360,0:27:50.000
with him they need to know two things

0:27:47.840,0:27:51.520
they need to know how fast he's going

0:27:50.000,0:27:53.679
and they need to know what direction

0:27:51.520,0:27:54.559
he's pointing in um so here's what we're

0:27:53.679,0:27:56.480
going to do

0:27:54.559,0:27:58.000
we're going to make a variable so go to

0:27:56.480,0:28:02.320
variables

0:27:58.000,0:28:04.480
we're going to call it dog direction

0:28:02.320,0:28:05.919
because the idea is is that these other

0:28:04.480,0:28:07.600
sheep if they're going to move with the

0:28:05.919,0:28:09.679
dog they've got to know his speed

0:28:07.600,0:28:11.440
which is already a global variable and

0:28:09.679,0:28:13.600
they also need to know his direction so

0:28:11.440,0:28:15.679
go ahead and save off dog direction

0:28:13.600,0:28:16.960
so what he's going to do is when he

0:28:15.679,0:28:20.320
moves

0:28:16.960,0:28:20.320
he's going to set

0:28:20.399,0:28:25.120
the variable called dog direction so

0:28:22.720,0:28:26.799
he's going to set dog direction

0:28:25.120,0:28:30.399
and inside motion there's actually a

0:28:26.799,0:28:31.919
variable already called direction

0:28:30.399,0:28:33.600
so he's going to set this global

0:28:31.919,0:28:36.159
variable that everybody can see

0:28:33.600,0:28:37.440
called dog direction to his direction so

0:28:36.159,0:28:39.919
now everybody knows

0:28:37.440,0:28:40.960
how fast he's going and what direction

0:28:39.919,0:28:42.480
he's pointing in

0:28:40.960,0:28:44.000
and then he's going to broadcast an

0:28:42.480,0:28:46.240
event

0:28:44.000,0:28:48.480
so he's going to so it's in events

0:28:46.240,0:28:50.960
broadcast

0:28:48.480,0:28:52.480
and the name of this message it could be

0:28:50.960,0:28:52.880
anything you want i'm just going to call

0:28:52.480,0:28:56.559
it

0:28:52.880,0:28:58.799
dog moved so the dog moved

0:28:56.559,0:28:59.919
so he's just telling everybody hey the

0:28:58.799,0:29:03.279
dog moved

0:28:59.919,0:29:04.720
um and then it'll be their job to see if

0:29:03.279,0:29:07.520
they also should move

0:29:04.720,0:29:08.159
right um and so he's broadcasting dog

0:29:07.520,0:29:10.720
move to

0:29:08.159,0:29:11.760
everybody and it's the sheep that are

0:29:10.720,0:29:15.120
gonna have to listen

0:29:11.760,0:29:16.960
right so let's come over to the sheep

0:29:15.120,0:29:18.799
um and this was part of our plan right

0:29:16.960,0:29:20.720
so we said that um

0:29:18.799,0:29:22.080
that the sheep uh we're gonna have to

0:29:20.720,0:29:22.960
move with the dog that was something

0:29:22.080,0:29:25.360
that we planned

0:29:22.960,0:29:26.480
so come in here to sheep and for the

0:29:25.360,0:29:30.399
sheep say

0:29:26.480,0:29:33.440
when i receive so find when i receive

0:29:30.399,0:29:34.720
so when i receive dog moved i have to

0:29:33.440,0:29:37.840
decide

0:29:34.720,0:29:38.799
if i should move too so campers i get

0:29:37.840,0:29:41.039
your opinion

0:29:38.799,0:29:43.440
how are how are the sheep gonna know if

0:29:41.039,0:29:45.279
they should move

0:29:43.440,0:29:47.520
if they're touching the dog if they're

0:29:45.279,0:29:52.559
touching the dog that's exactly right so

0:29:47.520,0:29:56.080
i'm gonna go into control and if

0:29:52.559,0:29:59.919
i am touching

0:29:56.080,0:30:00.480
the dog so if he moved and i'm touching

0:29:59.919,0:30:03.279
him

0:30:00.480,0:30:03.760
then i should move too and so what i

0:30:03.279,0:30:07.120
should do

0:30:03.760,0:30:09.840
is i should um point

0:30:07.120,0:30:11.440
in the same direction as the dog so i

0:30:09.840,0:30:12.559
should point myself in the dog's

0:30:11.440,0:30:14.080
direction

0:30:12.559,0:30:15.760
by the way i don't need to display that

0:30:14.080,0:30:16.559
on the screen so i can i can get rid of

0:30:15.760,0:30:19.200
that

0:30:16.559,0:30:19.919
i just hit the check mark here to not

0:30:19.200,0:30:21.360
display it

0:30:19.919,0:30:24.880
so i need to point in the direction of

0:30:21.360,0:30:28.720
the dog and i need to move

0:30:24.880,0:30:32.559
um at the speed of the dog

0:30:28.720,0:30:35.360
so dog speed and it will appear

0:30:32.559,0:30:37.200
visually like he's pushing me but really

0:30:35.360,0:30:37.679
i'm just traveling at the same speed as

0:30:37.200,0:30:39.840
him

0:30:37.679,0:30:40.720
and at the same direction as him let's

0:30:39.840,0:30:43.840
try it

0:30:40.720,0:30:46.559
and see if this works so now every time

0:30:43.840,0:30:47.840
i move i broadcast that i'm moving

0:30:46.559,0:30:50.240
but if they're not touching me then

0:30:47.840,0:30:50.960
nothing happens but if i start touching

0:30:50.240,0:30:53.039
this one

0:30:50.960,0:30:54.799
you can see how they snap to the same

0:30:53.039,0:30:56.880
direction so as soon as i touch this one

0:30:54.799,0:30:59.360
it snaps to the same direction

0:30:56.880,0:31:01.440
and it appears as though i'm moving them

0:30:59.360,0:31:02.720
which is cool

0:31:01.440,0:31:04.559
and so i'm going to push them to the

0:31:02.720,0:31:06.159
sheep push them to the pin when they get

0:31:04.559,0:31:08.799
to the pin nothing happens

0:31:06.159,0:31:10.320
notice that i can back right over them

0:31:08.799,0:31:12.960
and nothing big happens

0:31:10.320,0:31:14.559
and then i can push them in and this is

0:31:12.960,0:31:16.480
where kind of like backing up

0:31:14.559,0:31:18.640
makes you better at your game you'll

0:31:16.480,0:31:20.159
also notice that if you look at the code

0:31:18.640,0:31:22.080
it doesn't care if you're actually

0:31:20.159,0:31:24.480
behind them so this is kind of funny i'm

0:31:22.080,0:31:26.240
just going to put my tail on this guy

0:31:24.480,0:31:27.679
my tail is enough to make him come with

0:31:26.240,0:31:31.039
me right

0:31:27.679,0:31:32.559
um cool so this is going really well

0:31:31.039,0:31:34.240
i'm going to pause and help my campers

0:31:32.559,0:31:35.600
for a little bit um

0:31:34.240,0:31:37.440
all right so things are going really

0:31:35.600,0:31:38.080
good by the way this is a great time to

0:31:37.440,0:31:39.919
take a break

0:31:38.080,0:31:41.360
um our family we decided to just take a

0:31:39.919,0:31:42.640
little break we we jumped and touched

0:31:41.360,0:31:43.760
the ceiling for a little while we ate

0:31:42.640,0:31:45.200
some snacks

0:31:43.760,0:31:47.519
pause it take a little break good time

0:31:45.200,0:31:49.200
to take a break um hey i did notice one

0:31:47.519,0:31:51.360
thing i noticed that my dog

0:31:49.200,0:31:52.799
um he isn't going through different

0:31:51.360,0:31:54.480
costumes that's actually something i

0:31:52.799,0:31:56.159
meant to do earlier

0:31:54.480,0:31:58.159
let's fix this real quick go into the

0:31:56.159,0:32:00.159
dogs code

0:31:58.159,0:32:01.440
and go find his like main event loop

0:32:00.159,0:32:04.559
over here

0:32:01.440,0:32:07.600
and inside here uh just grab a

0:32:04.559,0:32:08.720
um next costume command uh where is it

0:32:07.600,0:32:10.000
at i always have trouble finding this

0:32:08.720,0:32:11.440
next costume

0:32:10.000,0:32:13.440
and just stick it you can honestly you

0:32:11.440,0:32:14.880
can stick it anywhere in this loop

0:32:13.440,0:32:15.919
i'm going to stick it right there it

0:32:14.880,0:32:17.679
doesn't really matter that way it just

0:32:15.919,0:32:19.279
kind of makes a cool pyramid

0:32:17.679,0:32:21.760
and so now you can see like as soon as i

0:32:19.279,0:32:23.919
stick it in there the dog starts uh

0:32:21.760,0:32:25.360
starts barking by the way when i first

0:32:23.919,0:32:27.039
made this game i

0:32:25.360,0:32:29.519
actually made a bark sound the whole

0:32:27.039,0:32:31.600
time it gets really annoying

0:32:29.519,0:32:32.880
right so if he just sits there and he

0:32:31.600,0:32:35.039
just barks the whole time you're just

0:32:32.880,0:32:37.120
like dog stop barking

0:32:35.039,0:32:39.919
all right so overall very happy with the

0:32:37.120,0:32:41.760
game i'd say it seems pretty obvious

0:32:39.919,0:32:43.039
what needs to happen next uh what

0:32:41.760,0:32:44.240
campers what do you guys think we should

0:32:43.039,0:32:46.640
do next

0:32:44.240,0:32:48.000
have the sheep actually go into the pen

0:32:46.640,0:32:50.000
have the sheep

0:32:48.000,0:32:51.679
have the sheep actually like go into the

0:32:50.000,0:32:53.760
pen that seems like a good thing

0:32:51.679,0:32:55.360
um and that's hopefully what our plan is

0:32:53.760,0:32:57.279
telling us to do next so

0:32:55.360,0:32:58.880
uh sheep touching the dog will move so

0:32:57.279,0:33:00.880
we did that one

0:32:58.880,0:33:02.720
and then our plan says the next thing is

0:33:00.880,0:33:05.919
sheep touching the pin

0:33:02.720,0:33:07.440
are moved into the pin um and we need to

0:33:05.919,0:33:07.919
track the number of sheep that are in

0:33:07.440,0:33:10.880
the pin

0:33:07.919,0:33:12.960
right so that's our next task so we

0:33:10.880,0:33:15.039
decided that responsibility would be on

0:33:12.960,0:33:18.320
the sheep so the sheep would do that

0:33:15.039,0:33:21.600
so let's go into the sheep's code

0:33:18.320,0:33:24.960
and so the sheep needs to check

0:33:21.600,0:33:26.320
if they're in the pen we could put that

0:33:24.960,0:33:28.559
code down here because this is where

0:33:26.320,0:33:30.240
they move so we could put it down here

0:33:28.559,0:33:31.679
or we could put it up here it honestly

0:33:30.240,0:33:34.720
doesn't matter

0:33:31.679,0:33:36.880
i'm going to choose to put it

0:33:34.720,0:33:38.320
as a forever loop up here just because

0:33:36.880,0:33:38.720
that's how i typically write code and

0:33:38.320,0:33:39.919
that

0:33:38.720,0:33:42.960
like there's something that you're doing

0:33:39.919,0:33:45.600
forever so i'm going to go into control

0:33:42.960,0:33:46.559
and i'm going to stick a forever loop um

0:33:45.600,0:33:49.679
on the bottom

0:33:46.559,0:33:51.200
of this when i start as clone script

0:33:49.679,0:33:54.080
so he's going to like go to some

0:33:51.200,0:33:57.120
position and then he's going to forever

0:33:54.080,0:34:00.480
check if he's touching the pin or not

0:33:57.120,0:34:04.080
so that's of course an if statement and

0:34:00.480,0:34:07.440
touching the pin is a sensing so

0:34:04.080,0:34:10.480
forever if i'm touching

0:34:07.440,0:34:11.839
uh the pen so the sheet pen then i'm

0:34:10.480,0:34:13.359
going to do the code that's inside of

0:34:11.839,0:34:15.359
here

0:34:13.359,0:34:16.399
the code that i want to do is i want to

0:34:15.359,0:34:18.960
increment a counter

0:34:16.399,0:34:20.000
so that we know how many sheep there are

0:34:18.960,0:34:22.879
and then i also want

0:34:20.000,0:34:23.919
to change the pin so that it looks like

0:34:22.879,0:34:25.520
i'm in there

0:34:23.919,0:34:27.200
and then i want to delete the clone so a

0:34:25.520,0:34:29.200
lot of things i need to do

0:34:27.200,0:34:31.040
let's do the variable first so click on

0:34:29.200,0:34:34.399
variables

0:34:31.040,0:34:36.720
let's make a variable we might

0:34:34.399,0:34:37.520
display this variable so i'm going to

0:34:36.720,0:34:39.040
use the

0:34:37.520,0:34:40.639
the naming convention that i use when

0:34:39.040,0:34:41.919
something is displayed

0:34:40.639,0:34:43.919
i make it public because i'm going to

0:34:41.919,0:34:48.240
display it and i'm going to call it num

0:34:43.919,0:34:50.320
sheep whenever you make a variable

0:34:48.240,0:34:51.599
you need to initialize its value

0:34:50.320,0:34:53.280
somewhere um

0:34:51.599,0:34:54.639
and the question of where do i

0:34:53.280,0:34:57.280
initialize the value

0:34:54.639,0:34:59.680
um that could be anywhere normally i'd

0:34:57.280,0:35:01.280
put something like that on the stage

0:34:59.680,0:35:02.640
this time i'm not using stage code so

0:35:01.280,0:35:05.280
i'm going to put it on the dog so the

0:35:02.640,0:35:06.800
dog already has like an initialized area

0:35:05.280,0:35:08.320
that seems like a good place to

0:35:06.800,0:35:11.520
initialize

0:35:08.320,0:35:12.480
uh num sheep uh to be zero as well so

0:35:11.520,0:35:14.240
this is like

0:35:12.480,0:35:16.160
number of sheep in the pen right if you

0:35:14.240,0:35:18.720
want to be very verbose about it

0:35:16.160,0:35:20.320
so i initialize it there so you make it

0:35:18.720,0:35:23.359
you initialize it

0:35:20.320,0:35:24.079
um and then you increment it over on the

0:35:23.359,0:35:25.760
sheep

0:35:24.079,0:35:28.320
again notice how i just seamlessly hop

0:35:25.760,0:35:30.640
back and forth from the sheep to the dog

0:35:28.320,0:35:31.440
so i'm going to change it in here so i'm

0:35:30.640,0:35:36.880
going to change

0:35:31.440,0:35:38.160
my num sheet so change num sheet by one

0:35:36.880,0:35:40.240
so that's an important thing i have to

0:35:38.160,0:35:42.960
do the next thing i have to do

0:35:40.240,0:35:44.800
is i need to um play a sound because we

0:35:42.960,0:35:46.720
always play sounds

0:35:44.800,0:35:49.119
let's go ahead and play i kind of like

0:35:46.720,0:35:52.240
pop because it's like i pop

0:35:49.119,0:35:56.079
into the pen so

0:35:52.240,0:35:58.000
code sound

0:35:56.079,0:35:59.520
play sound pop i'll go ahead and play it

0:35:58.000,0:36:00.800
until it's done

0:35:59.520,0:36:02.000
because i'm going to delete myself at

0:36:00.800,0:36:03.520
the end of this i want to make sure that

0:36:02.000,0:36:07.119
it plays

0:36:03.520,0:36:08.800
i also need to tell the pin to update

0:36:07.119,0:36:11.280
right so i'm going to need to tell the

0:36:08.800,0:36:13.119
pen to update whenever you communicate

0:36:11.280,0:36:14.640
from one sprite to another

0:36:13.119,0:36:16.240
uh campers what are we going to need to

0:36:14.640,0:36:16.800
do to communicate from one sprite to

0:36:16.240,0:36:19.119
another

0:36:16.800,0:36:21.119
broadcast we have to broadcast an event

0:36:19.119,0:36:24.480
um so he's going to

0:36:21.119,0:36:24.480
broadcast an event

0:36:24.880,0:36:28.079
i'm i'm gonna have to make a new event

0:36:26.400,0:36:31.359
name so a new message

0:36:28.079,0:36:33.440
i'm gonna call this one update pin

0:36:31.359,0:36:35.119
so i'm gonna broadcast that the pin

0:36:33.440,0:36:38.079
image needs to be updated

0:36:35.119,0:36:38.079
so update pin

0:36:38.960,0:36:42.240
um and then after i tell the pin to

0:36:41.599,0:36:44.880
update

0:36:42.240,0:36:46.000
i'm going to delete myself so i'm going

0:36:44.880,0:36:48.320
to come down

0:36:46.000,0:36:50.800
and control it's the bottom command

0:36:48.320,0:36:52.480
delete this clone

0:36:50.800,0:36:53.920
and so with code you want to do things

0:36:52.480,0:36:55.280
sequentially and you want to think about

0:36:53.920,0:36:56.640
what needs to happen

0:36:55.280,0:36:57.839
and then you've got to execute your plan

0:36:56.640,0:37:00.160
so i'm going to change the number of

0:36:57.839,0:37:01.760
sheet by one because i'm now in the pen

0:37:00.160,0:37:04.240
i'm going to play a sound because sounds

0:37:01.760,0:37:06.880
are fun i'm going to tell the pin hey

0:37:04.240,0:37:08.240
update pin and then i'm going to delete

0:37:06.880,0:37:11.119
this clone

0:37:08.240,0:37:12.880
so let's go ahead and go into the pen

0:37:11.119,0:37:17.599
and let's respond to

0:37:12.880,0:37:17.599
update pen so i'm in the pen now

0:37:17.760,0:37:25.040
in the pen i need to go to events

0:37:21.839,0:37:30.640
say when i receive

0:37:25.040,0:37:30.640
so when the pen receives update pen

0:37:31.200,0:37:34.560
he's going to use the variable num sheep

0:37:33.839,0:37:39.680
to set

0:37:34.560,0:37:39.680
his costume so looks

0:37:39.839,0:37:45.760
switch to costume

0:37:42.880,0:37:47.040
now the question is how do you switch to

0:37:45.760,0:37:49.760
the correct costume

0:37:47.040,0:37:50.079
right so it's going to somehow have to

0:37:49.760,0:37:53.599
be

0:37:50.079,0:37:56.240
based on uh num sheep right

0:37:53.599,0:37:58.480
and so let's look at his costumes so his

0:37:56.240,0:37:59.280
costumes have names they also have

0:37:58.480,0:38:01.760
numbers

0:37:59.280,0:38:02.480
so i could set this by saying costume

0:38:01.760,0:38:05.839
one

0:38:02.480,0:38:08.560
or the name which is called sheep zero

0:38:05.839,0:38:10.560
this is costume number two and its name

0:38:08.560,0:38:12.400
is sheep one

0:38:10.560,0:38:13.760
so there's kind of a weird off by one

0:38:12.400,0:38:16.800
here right so um

0:38:13.760,0:38:20.640
when the sheep is zero i want to use

0:38:16.800,0:38:22.400
costume one when the sheep is one

0:38:20.640,0:38:24.480
i want to use costume two so it's kind

0:38:22.400,0:38:27.200
of off by one there right

0:38:24.480,0:38:29.040
so um i'll ask my campers if i were to

0:38:27.200,0:38:30.320
put this in here it would work out badly

0:38:29.040,0:38:32.079
because it's kind of gotten off by one

0:38:30.320,0:38:33.040
so what do i need to do campers have you

0:38:32.079,0:38:35.280
figured this out

0:38:33.040,0:38:37.680
um number is sheep minus one yeah so

0:38:35.280,0:38:41.760
there's a a statement that it's

0:38:37.680,0:38:44.079
number sheep minus one um it's actually

0:38:41.760,0:38:44.960
not minus it's plus yeah yeah that makes

0:38:44.079,0:38:48.240
sense um

0:38:44.960,0:38:51.440
so i want uh plus so

0:38:48.240,0:38:53.520
number of sheep so my costume is equal

0:38:51.440,0:38:56.400
to the number of sheep so right now it's

0:38:53.520,0:38:58.160
num sheep is zero so i want costume one

0:38:56.400,0:39:01.359
does that make sense

0:38:58.160,0:39:03.680
and so as the number of sheep increases

0:39:01.359,0:39:05.760
um my costume is gonna gonna get better

0:39:03.680,0:39:07.839
and better and it'll look like

0:39:05.760,0:39:09.280
uh the sheep are going into the pen

0:39:07.839,0:39:11.599
right because the sheep

0:39:09.280,0:39:13.280
the clone itself is gonna get deleted uh

0:39:11.599,0:39:16.480
let's see if it works

0:39:13.280,0:39:19.200
so now i um i run i've got a couple

0:39:16.480,0:39:22.480
sheep here that are going in

0:39:19.200,0:39:22.480
so overall that was going good

0:39:25.520,0:39:28.880
one thing that was broken about my game

0:39:27.280,0:39:30.079
is when i started it it looked like

0:39:28.880,0:39:30.960
there was sheep in there it's like when

0:39:30.079,0:39:32.320
i started it

0:39:30.960,0:39:34.160
um it looked like there were sheep in

0:39:32.320,0:39:34.960
there that's a mistake and the reason it

0:39:34.160,0:39:38.320
did that

0:39:34.960,0:39:41.599
is because um i never reset

0:39:38.320,0:39:44.960
it to be empty does that make sense

0:39:41.599,0:39:47.359
so a task that i never predicted

0:39:44.960,0:39:48.960
was necessary i realized that i need to

0:39:47.359,0:39:52.000
do now i need to call

0:39:48.960,0:39:54.800
update pen when the game first starts

0:39:52.000,0:39:56.000
i'm going to do that from the dog so

0:39:54.800,0:39:57.920
this is a task that i

0:39:56.000,0:39:59.520
did not see coming which was fine i

0:39:57.920,0:40:02.000
didn't plan for this

0:39:59.520,0:40:03.760
i just know that i need to do it now so

0:40:02.000,0:40:06.560
i need to

0:40:03.760,0:40:07.599
um inside my initialize area i need to

0:40:06.560,0:40:10.319
broadcast

0:40:07.599,0:40:11.599
uh update pen and that way like see how

0:40:10.319,0:40:12.000
there's a bunch of people in there right

0:40:11.599,0:40:14.720
now

0:40:12.000,0:40:15.760
that way when the game starts it's going

0:40:14.720,0:40:17.599
to update the pen

0:40:15.760,0:40:19.280
uh to clear them all out in fact it

0:40:17.599,0:40:20.720
would probably look better if i did that

0:40:19.280,0:40:23.599
like really early right

0:40:20.720,0:40:24.000
so i set the number of sheep to zero and

0:40:23.599,0:40:26.240
then i

0:40:24.000,0:40:27.680
broadcast update pen then i do the rest

0:40:26.240,0:40:30.800
of the stuff

0:40:27.680,0:40:34.560
that way even if i um start with

0:40:30.800,0:40:36.319
a bunch of sheep in there when my game

0:40:34.560,0:40:38.960
starts

0:40:36.319,0:40:41.119
they'll they'll be gone by the way it

0:40:38.960,0:40:42.240
looks like my original sheep is uh still

0:40:41.119,0:40:44.480
on the screen here

0:40:42.240,0:40:45.920
um i'm gonna go back and hide my

0:40:44.480,0:40:48.480
original sheep i don't know

0:40:45.920,0:40:50.400
i don't know how he got unhidden uh but

0:40:48.480,0:40:52.160
i want my original uh to be hidden

0:40:50.400,0:40:54.640
until i'm going to move him way over in

0:40:52.160,0:40:56.560
the corner uh and hide him there

0:40:54.640,0:40:58.400
mckinley you got a statement so she has

0:40:56.560,0:41:01.520
a theory about how it happened and

0:40:58.400,0:41:02.319
uh that that probably writes this but

0:41:01.520,0:41:06.000
now i can put

0:41:02.319,0:41:09.040
sheep in here and it looks like they go

0:41:06.000,0:41:11.599
into the pen which is cool um and then

0:41:09.040,0:41:13.040
eventually i'll get the the final sheep

0:41:11.599,0:41:16.720
in there

0:41:13.040,0:41:21.200
um and then um nothing happens right

0:41:16.720,0:41:23.680
so our game is going really really good

0:41:21.200,0:41:25.280
we've got the sheep touching the pen are

0:41:23.680,0:41:26.240
moved in tracking the number of people

0:41:25.280,0:41:29.359
moved in

0:41:26.240,0:41:31.839
the only thing i need to do now is the

0:41:29.359,0:41:33.440
what's called the in-game stuff so i

0:41:31.839,0:41:34.880
need to

0:41:33.440,0:41:37.119
make sure i've started my timer which

0:41:34.880,0:41:38.960
we've already done that and then once

0:41:37.119,0:41:42.079
all the sheep are in the pin

0:41:38.960,0:41:43.040
the game ends and i check for fastest

0:41:42.079,0:41:44.720
time

0:41:43.040,0:41:46.079
let's go look to see what what the

0:41:44.720,0:41:47.200
solution did on this

0:41:46.079,0:41:50.000
so you can see that there was this

0:41:47.200,0:41:51.839
variable fastest time

0:41:50.000,0:41:53.599
um and the idea was is that it would

0:41:51.839,0:41:54.720
track how long it took you to get all

0:41:53.599,0:41:56.079
the sheep in

0:41:54.720,0:41:58.240
uh so i'll just go ahead and get them

0:41:56.079,0:41:59.839
all in again here

0:41:58.240,0:42:01.040
um all right so i paused it there just

0:41:59.839,0:42:01.440
so you didn't have to watch me collect

0:42:01.040,0:42:03.359
sheep

0:42:01.440,0:42:05.040
um but i'm about to push the final two

0:42:03.359,0:42:06.720
sheep in and then i'm going to let you

0:42:05.040,0:42:08.800
see this is the solution what should

0:42:06.720,0:42:10.240
happen

0:42:08.800,0:42:12.400
and so what should happen is it should

0:42:10.240,0:42:14.319
bark a few times

0:42:12.400,0:42:15.599
it should say a message about how long

0:42:14.319,0:42:17.599
it took you

0:42:15.599,0:42:19.200
and then if it was the fastest time then

0:42:17.599,0:42:21.599
it should update the fastest time so

0:42:19.200,0:42:23.200
there's a lot of details going on there

0:42:21.599,0:42:24.960
so let's go ahead and see

0:42:23.200,0:42:26.400
if we can do some of those things so

0:42:24.960,0:42:27.760
when all the sheep are in the pen the

0:42:26.400,0:42:29.440
game ends

0:42:27.760,0:42:31.680
our plan is that that's going to be a

0:42:29.440,0:42:35.520
responsibility of the dog

0:42:31.680,0:42:35.520
so let's go into the dogs code

0:42:35.680,0:42:39.680
and a function we have never used is

0:42:37.920,0:42:41.280
actually this check for game over so now

0:42:39.680,0:42:44.480
we're going to focus on

0:42:41.280,0:42:45.839
a check for game over so what check for

0:42:44.480,0:42:49.359
game over needs to do

0:42:45.839,0:42:50.800
is it needs to check to see if num sheep

0:42:49.359,0:42:52.960
is 10.

0:42:50.800,0:42:53.920
maybe i zoomed in too much there so i

0:42:52.960,0:42:58.079
need to check

0:42:53.920,0:43:02.000
if my number of sheep is equal to

0:42:58.079,0:43:05.760
10 so i need an operator for equals

0:43:02.000,0:43:08.800
i need a num sheep

0:43:05.760,0:43:11.760
is equal to 10. so if that

0:43:08.800,0:43:12.160
happens then i need to start my game

0:43:11.760,0:43:15.760
over

0:43:12.160,0:43:18.000
sequence right so my game over sequence

0:43:15.760,0:43:21.119
has to do a couple of things

0:43:18.000,0:43:24.560
it has to um say a message

0:43:21.119,0:43:26.800
so let's just go ahead and go into looks

0:43:24.560,0:43:28.160
i'm going to choose to have him think it

0:43:26.800,0:43:29.920
right

0:43:28.160,0:43:32.880
um and so i'm going to have him think

0:43:29.920,0:43:36.319
like you win

0:43:32.880,0:43:39.760
is how i'm going to start to test this

0:43:36.319,0:43:40.160
i could play the whole game it becomes

0:43:39.760,0:43:42.079
very

0:43:40.160,0:43:43.760
tedious to test the whole game because

0:43:42.079,0:43:45.920
you have to actually get to 10 sheep

0:43:43.760,0:43:47.520
so here's what i'm gonna do to make

0:43:45.920,0:43:51.680
testing easier

0:43:47.520,0:43:53.440
i'm gonna temporarily set this to one

0:43:51.680,0:43:54.560
now whenever you do temporary testing

0:43:53.440,0:43:55.359
like that you've got to remember to put

0:43:54.560,0:43:57.359
it back later

0:43:55.359,0:43:59.200
right but now you can see that we can

0:43:57.359,0:44:02.960
test this much faster

0:43:59.200,0:44:05.119
because we just have to get one sheep in

0:44:02.960,0:44:07.119
and then it'll it'll save my message now

0:44:05.119,0:44:10.560
what i want my message to say

0:44:07.119,0:44:13.680
is i want my message to be more complex

0:44:10.560,0:44:16.560
i wanted to say you collected

0:44:13.680,0:44:16.560
all the sheep

0:44:17.599,0:44:23.200
in some number of seconds right

0:44:21.440,0:44:24.720
it turns out that you you can't put the

0:44:23.200,0:44:26.640
variable right into the sentence here

0:44:24.720,0:44:29.520
unless you use this thing called a

0:44:26.640,0:44:31.119
a join operator so here's what i'm going

0:44:29.520,0:44:33.280
to do i'm actually going to like

0:44:31.119,0:44:37.839
slowly join this together so i'm going

0:44:33.280,0:44:37.839
to say you collected all the sheep in

0:44:37.920,0:44:41.839
and then it's going to say like some

0:44:39.440,0:44:44.000
number of seconds

0:44:41.839,0:44:46.400
and so what i want to do here uh keegan

0:44:44.000,0:44:49.760
i'll help you type this don't worry

0:44:46.400,0:44:51.760
i'm going to grab the timer the timer is

0:44:49.760,0:44:54.720
in sensing

0:44:51.760,0:44:55.520
so timer is right here so you collected

0:44:54.720,0:44:59.440
all the sheep

0:44:55.520,0:45:02.319
in this many seconds

0:44:59.440,0:45:04.000
can you see how i built that up so i i

0:45:02.319,0:45:06.000
started off with

0:45:04.000,0:45:08.000
this thing you collected all the sheep

0:45:06.000,0:45:09.680
in timer

0:45:08.000,0:45:11.680
and then on this one down here it says

0:45:09.680,0:45:13.280
apple seconds but where it currently

0:45:11.680,0:45:13.760
says apple i'm going to drop this other

0:45:13.280,0:45:16.560
one

0:45:13.760,0:45:18.079
so i'm going to say you collected all

0:45:16.560,0:45:20.640
the sheep in

0:45:18.079,0:45:21.920
blank seconds and then to make sure that

0:45:20.640,0:45:25.280
there's spaces i'm going to make sure

0:45:21.920,0:45:26.720
that there's a space after the word in

0:45:25.280,0:45:28.160
just to make sure that there's a space

0:45:26.720,0:45:29.119
there and then i'm going to make sure

0:45:28.160,0:45:31.200
that there's a space

0:45:29.119,0:45:33.839
before the word seconds right so there's

0:45:31.200,0:45:38.079
actually kind of like a space there

0:45:33.839,0:45:38.079
and so i'm going to stick that in here

0:45:38.319,0:45:41.920
and so i'm going to say go so now when i

0:45:40.880,0:45:46.000
get one sheep

0:45:41.920,0:45:48.720
in it says you collected all the sheep

0:45:46.000,0:45:50.079
in four point blah blah blah seconds um

0:45:48.720,0:45:52.800
and notice that

0:45:50.079,0:45:54.400
the game keeps playing uh well the the

0:45:52.800,0:45:57.599
game keeps playing that's fine

0:45:54.400,0:46:01.040
um i'm gonna stick on a stop all

0:45:57.599,0:46:02.160
at the bottom here so now the game won't

0:46:01.040,0:46:04.560
keep playing

0:46:02.160,0:46:07.040
but as soon as i get one sheep in it'll

0:46:04.560,0:46:08.400
say you collected all the sheep in 4.5

0:46:07.040,0:46:09.760
seconds

0:46:08.400,0:46:11.119
that's just a little faster than i can

0:46:09.760,0:46:12.960
read so i'm going to bump the message up

0:46:11.119,0:46:15.359
to like four seconds

0:46:12.960,0:46:16.240
and you can see how useful it is uh to

0:46:15.359,0:46:18.000
do

0:46:16.240,0:46:20.480
fast testing you collected all the sheep

0:46:18.000,0:46:22.960
in 4.18 seconds

0:46:20.480,0:46:24.880
great i'm going to help keegan type this

0:46:22.960,0:46:27.119
all right so we are doing super good the

0:46:24.880,0:46:29.119
only thing i want to add is i want to

0:46:27.119,0:46:30.560
keep track of the fastest time to make

0:46:29.119,0:46:33.920
it like a game right

0:46:30.560,0:46:38.079
so let's go to variables make a variable

0:46:33.920,0:46:39.920
make the variable called fastest time

0:46:38.079,0:46:41.440
for all sprites you can see that i'm

0:46:39.920,0:46:44.079
planning on showing this

0:46:41.440,0:46:45.359
so i use my like show it on the screen

0:46:44.079,0:46:46.800
format

0:46:45.359,0:46:48.079
by the way num sheep i don't think i

0:46:46.800,0:46:49.359
really need to show that so i'm gonna

0:46:48.079,0:46:51.040
hide numb sheep

0:46:49.359,0:46:52.880
um and fastest time i'm gonna actually

0:46:51.040,0:46:56.000
put it up in this corner just because uh

0:46:52.880,0:46:59.520
this corner is where my dog starts right

0:46:56.000,0:47:02.560
um cool so let's go ahead and

0:46:59.520,0:47:03.680
have a cheat to where we can reset it so

0:47:02.560,0:47:06.720
here's what i want to do

0:47:03.680,0:47:10.560
if you press the space bar then

0:47:06.720,0:47:13.839
set fastest time

0:47:10.560,0:47:16.720
to 999 999

0:47:13.839,0:47:18.560
so um we made the variable and then the

0:47:16.720,0:47:19.280
way we initialize it is kind of a funny

0:47:18.560,0:47:21.359
system

0:47:19.280,0:47:23.280
um you press the space bar and it'll

0:47:21.359,0:47:26.079
just set it to 999. so that way it kind

0:47:23.280,0:47:28.800
of like resets the fastest time so it

0:47:26.079,0:47:29.599
resets the high scores board so now what

0:47:28.800,0:47:32.559
we want to do

0:47:29.599,0:47:35.200
is inside this check for game over i

0:47:32.559,0:47:37.520
want to see if this is the fastest time

0:47:35.200,0:47:38.720
so really what i want to do is i want an

0:47:37.520,0:47:40.240
if statement so i'm going to go to

0:47:38.720,0:47:41.280
control

0:47:40.240,0:47:42.240
and i'm going to set it down here

0:47:41.280,0:47:44.000
because i'm going to do like a little

0:47:42.240,0:47:46.960
planning first

0:47:44.000,0:47:46.960
so i'm going to say if

0:47:47.200,0:47:51.760
something is less than something else my

0:47:50.160,0:47:53.040
campers told me i was going too fast so

0:47:51.760,0:47:55.839
i'll pause for just a minute here

0:47:53.040,0:47:57.040
um so um so we made this variable

0:47:55.839,0:47:59.040
fastest time

0:47:57.040,0:48:00.160
we made this win space key press set it

0:47:59.040,0:48:01.599
to 999.

0:48:00.160,0:48:03.280
um and now we're kind of like building

0:48:01.599,0:48:04.720
up an if statement over here so this is

0:48:03.280,0:48:06.319
eventually going to get in my code but

0:48:04.720,0:48:07.839
right now it's over here so i'm going to

0:48:06.319,0:48:10.480
say if

0:48:07.839,0:48:12.160
my current time is less than the

0:48:10.480,0:48:13.839
previous fastest

0:48:12.160,0:48:15.920
so i'm going to on the right hand side

0:48:13.839,0:48:16.800
it's going to be like so if my current

0:48:15.920,0:48:19.920
time

0:48:16.800,0:48:23.200
is less than fastest the current time by

0:48:19.920,0:48:26.480
the way is a variable that's in sensing

0:48:23.200,0:48:28.559
so i'm going to come down to um sensing

0:48:26.480,0:48:32.000
and so it's the timer

0:48:28.559,0:48:35.280
that's what it's called so if the timer

0:48:32.000,0:48:35.839
is less than fastest time um and then

0:48:35.280,0:48:39.040
i'm gonna

0:48:35.839,0:48:42.800
set fastest time if that happens so

0:48:39.040,0:48:46.240
set fastest time

0:48:42.800,0:48:47.680
equal to uh the timer

0:48:46.240,0:48:50.240
so i had to kind of like jump back and

0:48:47.680,0:48:52.000
forth uh quite a bit there

0:48:50.240,0:48:54.319
but i think the concept is pretty clear

0:48:52.000,0:48:55.760
so like if the timer is less than

0:48:54.319,0:48:59.920
fastest time

0:48:55.760,0:49:02.559
then set fastest time to timer

0:48:59.920,0:49:04.160
and i want to stick this if statement

0:49:02.559,0:49:07.119
just above

0:49:04.160,0:49:09.040
uh where it does the thinking i chose to

0:49:07.119,0:49:10.960
put it above the thinking because i

0:49:09.040,0:49:14.720
don't want that thinking

0:49:10.960,0:49:16.240
to like hurt my fastest time right

0:49:14.720,0:49:17.920
um oops it looks like it's kind of

0:49:16.240,0:49:19.920
blurred there

0:49:17.920,0:49:21.680
um so i could test that but i'm gonna do

0:49:19.920,0:49:23.920
one more thing uh really quick

0:49:21.680,0:49:24.720
um i'm gonna choose to to bark a couple

0:49:23.920,0:49:27.280
times

0:49:24.720,0:49:29.040
um there's a sound that's built in uh

0:49:27.280,0:49:30.960
called bark uh it's actually already

0:49:29.040,0:49:32.480
here on the dog

0:49:30.960,0:49:35.839
and i'm going to choose to bark four

0:49:32.480,0:49:39.599
times so to bark four times

0:49:35.839,0:49:42.720
i'm gonna grab a repeat four

0:49:39.599,0:49:45.119
and in sound i'm going to play sound

0:49:42.720,0:49:47.440
bark until done four times

0:49:45.119,0:49:48.160
um and that'll be like the last uh thing

0:49:47.440,0:49:51.920
that i do

0:49:48.160,0:49:53.119
right so i'm gonna think that thought

0:49:51.920,0:49:55.280
for a little while

0:49:53.119,0:49:57.119
uh and then i'm gonna bark some uh and

0:49:55.280,0:49:59.200
then the game will be over

0:49:57.119,0:50:01.119
you could choose to bark first you could

0:49:59.200,0:50:03.280
choose to do them at the same time

0:50:01.119,0:50:05.200
there's lots of ways you could do it i'm

0:50:03.280,0:50:07.280
currently at num1

0:50:05.200,0:50:08.319
but i want to try it at num1 just to see

0:50:07.280,0:50:11.359
if it works

0:50:08.319,0:50:12.640
so i'm going to slowly win the game so i

0:50:11.359,0:50:17.200
slowly won the game

0:50:12.640,0:50:19.440
so that took 7.342 seconds

0:50:17.200,0:50:21.040
and then the machine gun barking that's

0:50:19.440,0:50:22.400
fine now i'm going to

0:50:21.040,0:50:24.400
quickly win the game so you can see

0:50:22.400,0:50:26.240
right now it's 7.4 seconds but if i

0:50:24.400,0:50:29.359
quickly win the game

0:50:26.240,0:50:31.680
um oops i caught too many sheep

0:50:29.359,0:50:33.040
hold on i need to catch only one jeep

0:50:31.680,0:50:35.200
kind of a bad test

0:50:33.040,0:50:36.319
um does this look like one sheep to you

0:50:35.200,0:50:38.160
keegan

0:50:36.319,0:50:39.359
uh yeah that didn't work either all

0:50:38.160,0:50:42.079
right i can do this

0:50:39.359,0:50:44.079
i've got to catch exactly one sheep uh

0:50:42.079,0:50:45.760
so let's try to catch exactly one sheep

0:50:44.079,0:50:49.040
for my test

0:50:45.760,0:50:52.400
um so 6.17 seconds i

0:50:49.040,0:50:54.160
work and then my machine gun bark

0:50:52.400,0:50:56.319
by the way if you if you don't like how

0:50:54.160,0:51:00.079
that worked you could bark

0:50:56.319,0:51:02.000
um at the same time um as you think

0:51:00.079,0:51:03.440
things

0:51:02.000,0:51:05.119
i don't know if i would recommend this

0:51:03.440,0:51:08.160
but but you could change it

0:51:05.119,0:51:09.359
so i i switched it right so i switched

0:51:08.160,0:51:12.800
it to where it's going to like

0:51:09.359,0:51:16.000
bark first and then it's going to think

0:51:12.800,0:51:16.000
at the same time it's barking

0:51:16.160,0:51:19.200
don't care if you change that or not

0:51:17.280,0:51:21.280
whichever you want last thing i want to

0:51:19.200,0:51:23.520
do is put this back to 10

0:51:21.280,0:51:25.200
and i should have a finished game i'm

0:51:23.520,0:51:27.760
going to play it one time

0:51:25.200,0:51:31.440
see if it works and so i'm going to go

0:51:27.760,0:51:31.440
ahead and put my sheep in the pin here

0:51:31.760,0:51:35.440
my fastest time by the way is currently

0:51:33.760,0:51:37.040
6.1 seconds

0:51:35.440,0:51:39.200
i'm just going to hit the space bar to

0:51:37.040,0:51:41.359
reset it

0:51:39.200,0:51:42.559
and now as soon as i get these guys in

0:51:41.359,0:51:47.760
then i've got my

0:51:42.559,0:51:49.680
new record so 17.3 not bad

0:51:47.760,0:51:52.160
i was going to try to beat it just one

0:51:49.680,0:51:53.200
time so i think that i can beat 17

0:51:52.160,0:51:55.760
seconds

0:51:53.200,0:51:57.359
so i'm going to get them all in i find a

0:51:55.760,0:51:59.520
good trick is to go backwards with the

0:51:57.359,0:52:00.800
dog and if you want to be really fast

0:51:59.520,0:52:02.880
don't even get all the way behind them

0:52:00.800,0:52:04.160
just get like on them and that's

0:52:02.880,0:52:07.359
actually enough for the dog

0:52:04.160,0:52:10.079
i got 15.7 seconds uh so i

0:52:07.359,0:52:12.880
i'm a winner uh once i finish my game

0:52:10.079,0:52:15.040
what i like to do is i like to share it

0:52:12.880,0:52:17.119
um and i like to add some instructions

0:52:15.040,0:52:20.960
so use the sheep dog

0:52:17.119,0:52:24.400
to put your sheep in the pen with

0:52:20.960,0:52:27.920
up down left and

0:52:24.400,0:52:29.520
right arrows cool

0:52:27.920,0:52:31.119
and then i could tell how to reset the

0:52:29.520,0:52:33.359
high score but i won't

0:52:31.119,0:52:34.720
now i've got a url that i could send to

0:52:33.359,0:52:36.240
uh to grandparents

0:52:34.720,0:52:37.839
to friends to family and things like

0:52:36.240,0:52:39.359
that um

0:52:37.839,0:52:42.079
i suppose i should check in on my

0:52:39.359,0:52:44.480
campers to see to see how they're doing

0:52:42.079,0:52:45.839
so campers let's see how you did all

0:52:44.480,0:52:46.400
right so keegan you're gonna show yours

0:52:45.839,0:52:49.200
first

0:52:46.400,0:52:51.440
um this game uh has a little bit less

0:52:49.200,0:52:52.960
originality uh but go ahead and um

0:52:51.440,0:52:55.119
hope keegan's ready to score his last

0:52:52.960,0:52:57.760
sheep um and it looks like he

0:52:55.119,0:52:59.680
uh collected them all in 37 seconds

0:52:57.760,0:53:01.240
which is his fastest time

0:52:59.680,0:53:03.040
since did you get yours working

0:53:01.240,0:53:04.800
[Music]

0:53:03.040,0:53:06.640
so i made her wait with only one sheep

0:53:04.800,0:53:09.280
left too because it takes a while

0:53:06.640,0:53:10.720
her fastest time is 70 seconds uh and

0:53:09.280,0:53:12.480
this one because i made her weight

0:53:10.720,0:53:14.720
is going to be worse but i just want to

0:53:12.480,0:53:16.760
see if it works so it says yep

0:53:14.720,0:53:18.480
you collected them all um and it was in

0:53:16.760,0:53:21.760
115 seconds

0:53:18.480,0:53:22.960
uh great so you guys can keep playing uh

0:53:21.760,0:53:23.520
to see if you can collect them even

0:53:22.960,0:53:25.119
faster

0:53:23.520,0:53:26.960
did you guys have fun with the hardest

0:53:25.119,0:53:29.599
project of the whole week yes

0:53:26.960,0:53:31.040
cool i'm glad you liked it i think this

0:53:29.599,0:53:32.880
is a fun one i'm sorry it doesn't allow

0:53:31.040,0:53:35.359
for more uh creativity

0:53:32.880,0:53:36.960
uh but we kind of have to like focus it

0:53:35.359,0:53:38.079
just to uh just to be able to do this

0:53:36.960,0:53:41.280
whole thing

0:53:38.079,0:53:41.599
uh so the summary of this um is really

0:53:41.280,0:53:44.880
just

0:53:41.599,0:53:48.240
coding is fun i need to update the slide

0:53:44.880,0:53:51.440
and we learned a lot of cool skills uh

0:53:48.240,0:53:52.640
about planning how do you tackle uh big

0:53:51.440,0:53:54.880
projects

0:53:52.640,0:53:56.000
and how do you assign responsibilities

0:53:54.880,0:53:58.160
we also learned a lot

0:53:56.000,0:53:59.440
of cool tricks about like communication

0:53:58.160,0:54:01.200
between sprites

0:53:59.440,0:54:02.640
uh and having the dog move the sheep

0:54:01.200,0:54:05.280
into the pen

0:54:02.640,0:54:06.880
whew that was a big one very impressed

0:54:05.280,0:54:07.839
pat yourself on the back if you finished

0:54:06.880,0:54:10.160
today

0:54:07.839,0:54:13.130
you are over the hump and we will see

0:54:10.160,0:54:16.119
you again tomorrow

0:54:13.130,0:54:19.119
[Music]

0:54:16.119,0:54:19.119
bye
