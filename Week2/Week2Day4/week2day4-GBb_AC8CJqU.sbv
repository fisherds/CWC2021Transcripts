[Music]

0:00:04.799,0:00:09.519
hey hey welcome back

0:00:06.160,0:00:10.160
it is day four uh of our week two coding

0:00:09.519,0:00:12.160
camp

0:00:10.160,0:00:14.160
uh today's activity is going to be

0:00:12.160,0:00:16.720
called slide puzzle

0:00:14.160,0:00:18.080
i'm here with my campers as per usual

0:00:16.720,0:00:19.119
i'll let them go ahead and introduce

0:00:18.080,0:00:22.480
themselves

0:00:19.119,0:00:24.800
hello my name is keegan fisher hi

0:00:22.480,0:00:27.359
i'm mckenley you seem asleep today

0:00:24.800,0:00:30.720
mckenna are you ready to code today

0:00:27.359,0:00:33.360
is it too early for you today all right

0:00:30.720,0:00:34.000
we're uh we're ready to go today uh so

0:00:33.360,0:00:35.920
today

0:00:34.000,0:00:38.399
uh is called slide puzzle uh and it's

0:00:35.920,0:00:41.120
gonna start just a little bit different

0:00:38.399,0:00:42.800
in that i normally show you the solution

0:00:41.120,0:00:44.480
uh but today what i want you to do is i

0:00:42.800,0:00:45.520
want you to open the solution and play

0:00:44.480,0:00:47.920
with it

0:00:45.520,0:00:50.160
and so the the link is uh is clickable

0:00:47.920,0:00:51.600
there but i think it's probably easiest

0:00:50.160,0:00:53.520
if you just kind of look at the real

0:00:51.600,0:00:54.800
link so i'm going to make this link

0:00:53.520,0:00:56.719
available below the

0:00:54.800,0:00:59.359
the video in the email also on the

0:00:56.719,0:01:00.879
website but worst case scenario you can

0:00:59.359,0:01:03.199
look at my screen and type it here so

0:01:00.879,0:01:07.360
it's scratch.mit.edu

0:01:03.199,0:01:07.360
projects and then this number is

0:01:08.600,0:01:12.799
537-036-624

0:01:10.479,0:01:14.159
and this is called a slide puzzle with

0:01:12.799,0:01:16.320
check solve

0:01:14.159,0:01:18.479
all right so let's go ahead and uh play

0:01:16.320,0:01:22.880
this game uh to learn more about it

0:01:18.479,0:01:25.119
so go ahead and uh hit the green flag

0:01:22.880,0:01:26.880
um and so what this puzzle is it's

0:01:25.119,0:01:30.079
called a slide puzzle

0:01:26.880,0:01:31.280
you click on a piece and you make it go

0:01:30.079,0:01:33.920
into the gap

0:01:31.280,0:01:36.240
and your goal is you want to try to get

0:01:33.920,0:01:37.360
the puzzle to be rearranged properly

0:01:36.240,0:01:40.240
again

0:01:37.360,0:01:42.000
so take a minute and play with it and

0:01:40.240,0:01:44.159
see if you can make progress

0:01:42.000,0:01:46.079
uh towards getting it rearranged my

0:01:44.159,0:01:47.439
strategy is i always do the opening row

0:01:46.079,0:01:48.640
first you'll notice that each of these

0:01:47.439,0:01:50.079
tiles has kind of

0:01:48.640,0:01:52.159
got a number on it so you'll know when

0:01:50.079,0:01:53.360
it's right

0:01:52.159,0:01:54.880
and then mine's going to actually be

0:01:53.360,0:01:55.439
pretty easy to solve here just a couple

0:01:54.880,0:01:57.200
more

0:01:55.439,0:01:58.960
uh so one more click and i'm gonna solve

0:01:57.200,0:02:01.119
this thing i can tell so you'll notice

0:01:58.960,0:02:03.520
that there's a three by three grid

0:02:01.119,0:02:04.320
uh but there's only eight image tiles

0:02:03.520,0:02:05.840
present

0:02:04.320,0:02:09.520
because one has to be gone for the blank

0:02:05.840,0:02:11.680
but when you solve it

0:02:09.520,0:02:12.800
it should cheer for you loudly as per

0:02:11.680,0:02:15.760
usual

0:02:12.800,0:02:16.800
and then fill in uh that missing blank

0:02:15.760,0:02:18.720
so take a minute

0:02:16.800,0:02:20.480
uh and play around with it you'll notice

0:02:18.720,0:02:23.440
that whenever you hit the green flag

0:02:20.480,0:02:25.280
it'll kind of shuffle around what we

0:02:23.440,0:02:26.560
actually want to do first today

0:02:25.280,0:02:28.160
is we want to show you the game that

0:02:26.560,0:02:28.959
we're making which is which is this game

0:02:28.160,0:02:30.800
here

0:02:28.959,0:02:32.239
but we want to teach you an algorithm

0:02:30.800,0:02:34.640
for solving it

0:02:32.239,0:02:36.160
also just kind of like spoiler the goal

0:02:34.640,0:02:37.760
for today is for you to make your own

0:02:36.160,0:02:39.120
picture in here so be thinking about

0:02:37.760,0:02:40.319
what picture

0:02:39.120,0:02:41.840
you might want to put in here it could

0:02:40.319,0:02:43.440
be a picture like that you took like

0:02:41.840,0:02:45.200
with a camera picture

0:02:43.440,0:02:46.640
or it could be just like some image that

0:02:45.200,0:02:49.599
you enjoy doing

0:02:46.640,0:02:51.280
so let's learn um an algorithm for

0:02:49.599,0:02:52.480
trying to solve this thing

0:02:51.280,0:02:54.800
so i'm going to go over to the slides

0:02:52.480,0:02:57.440
here so the algorithm

0:02:54.800,0:03:00.000
um that we're trying to figure out is

0:02:57.440,0:03:00.959
how to solve this one row at a time

0:03:00.000,0:03:03.200
and so i'm just going to tell you the

0:03:00.959,0:03:05.200
big picture so the the first few steps

0:03:03.200,0:03:07.360
are designed to help you get

0:03:05.200,0:03:08.720
tiles one two and three correct so

0:03:07.360,0:03:10.400
that's that's the focus

0:03:08.720,0:03:12.080
whenever you're working on tiles one two

0:03:10.400,0:03:13.040
and three you also need the row below it

0:03:12.080,0:03:14.720
to get ready

0:03:13.040,0:03:16.159
this algorithm will work no matter how

0:03:14.720,0:03:18.239
big the puzzle is right so you've got

0:03:16.159,0:03:19.599
one row you're trying to solve for

0:03:18.239,0:03:21.760
and then the row you're kind of working

0:03:19.599,0:03:23.120
with below it and ultimately you're

0:03:21.760,0:03:25.120
trying to get them

0:03:23.120,0:03:27.120
one two and three together but we're

0:03:25.120,0:03:28.480
going to kind of stage them starting in

0:03:27.120,0:03:30.799
location six which is kind of the

0:03:28.480,0:03:32.159
opposite corner so here's the solving

0:03:30.799,0:03:34.640
strategy we're going to do

0:03:32.159,0:03:36.159
get tile number one so this is tile

0:03:34.640,0:03:36.720
number one the one that's got it one on

0:03:36.159,0:03:39.120
it

0:03:36.720,0:03:40.480
into location six and so you can see

0:03:39.120,0:03:42.239
we've numbered the locations one two

0:03:40.480,0:03:44.400
three four five six seven eight nine

0:03:42.239,0:03:46.640
so we want to get tile one into location

0:03:44.400,0:03:49.120
six making sure that tiles

0:03:46.640,0:03:50.080
two isn't like stuck in positions three

0:03:49.120,0:03:52.000
or six

0:03:50.080,0:03:53.760
so uh go ahead and do that i'll go ahead

0:03:52.000,0:03:55.519
and do mine as well

0:03:53.760,0:03:57.120
so i can see that that tile two is

0:03:55.519,0:03:58.400
somewhere way over here so he's way out

0:03:57.120,0:03:59.439
of the way so i'm not even worried about

0:03:58.400,0:04:01.519
him

0:03:59.439,0:04:03.200
and then i'm just going to get tile one

0:04:01.519,0:04:04.799
so this is tile one right here into

0:04:03.200,0:04:06.720
location six

0:04:04.799,0:04:08.799
making sure that tile two isn't trapped

0:04:06.720,0:04:11.120
so tile two is is not trapped

0:04:08.799,0:04:12.560
um trapped would be like so see how tile

0:04:11.120,0:04:13.439
five here is kind of like trapped up

0:04:12.560,0:04:14.879
there

0:04:13.439,0:04:16.799
and tile six it's kind of like trapped

0:04:14.879,0:04:18.160
down here so long as tile two

0:04:16.799,0:04:19.919
isn't like that you should be in good

0:04:18.160,0:04:22.000
shape

0:04:19.919,0:04:23.120
the next step after this this is the

0:04:22.000,0:04:24.639
algorithm

0:04:23.120,0:04:26.880
by the way has anybody ever solved a

0:04:24.639,0:04:28.720
rubik's cube i know that my kids have

0:04:26.880,0:04:30.160
rubik's cubes are really tricky and so

0:04:28.720,0:04:31.520
like you can just play with rubik's

0:04:30.160,0:04:33.199
cubes to your heart's content but you

0:04:31.520,0:04:35.040
may not ever make progress

0:04:33.199,0:04:36.479
but if you have one of these algorithms

0:04:35.040,0:04:38.639
for solving a rubik's cube

0:04:36.479,0:04:40.000
you'll probably be successful and since

0:04:38.639,0:04:42.000
this is a coding camp

0:04:40.000,0:04:43.520
being able to implement algorithms is is

0:04:42.000,0:04:45.840
good for us to learn anyway

0:04:43.520,0:04:48.240
so the first step in the algorithm is to

0:04:45.840,0:04:50.160
get tile 1 to location 6.

0:04:48.240,0:04:51.280
the next step in the algorithm is pretty

0:04:50.160,0:04:54.560
easy move

0:04:51.280,0:04:58.000
tile 2 into location 5. so i just want

0:04:54.560,0:05:00.080
to get tile 2 to be right next to it

0:04:58.000,0:05:02.240
and this may seem kind of weird at first

0:05:00.080,0:05:03.840
but you'll hopefully understand the

0:05:02.240,0:05:05.440
the reasons behind this but we're trying

0:05:03.840,0:05:06.880
to stage these tile

0:05:05.440,0:05:08.960
1 2 because we're trying to like get

0:05:06.880,0:05:10.560
this top row together all right so i've

0:05:08.960,0:05:13.280
got tile 2 in the middle looks like my

0:05:10.560,0:05:15.039
campers are caught up so that's good

0:05:13.280,0:05:17.600
uh the next step is we want to kind of

0:05:15.039,0:05:20.320
slide one and two around a little bit

0:05:17.600,0:05:21.360
so tile one you can see had to go up one

0:05:20.320,0:05:24.400
spot

0:05:21.360,0:05:26.240
tile two had to like follow it around

0:05:24.400,0:05:28.320
and do that and make sure that tile

0:05:26.240,0:05:31.440
three is not like stuck in the bottom

0:05:28.320,0:05:32.720
uh when you do this maneuver so first

0:05:31.440,0:05:34.000
i'm gonna find tile three

0:05:32.720,0:05:36.160
uh so it looks like he's way over here

0:05:34.000,0:05:37.840
so he's actually in good shape for me

0:05:36.160,0:05:39.199
if he was stuck like down here in

0:05:37.840,0:05:40.560
location six i would kind of have to

0:05:39.199,0:05:43.360
move him out first

0:05:40.560,0:05:45.120
but i want to move tile one up and tile

0:05:43.360,0:05:46.960
two over

0:05:45.120,0:05:48.160
making sure that tile three isn't stuck

0:05:46.960,0:05:50.400
so you can kind of see how

0:05:48.160,0:05:51.600
um six would be stuck in position nine

0:05:50.400,0:05:52.960
here like you couldn't get it out of

0:05:51.600,0:05:54.639
there

0:05:52.960,0:05:57.440
alright so now i'm ready for the next

0:05:54.639,0:05:59.840
step so i want to move tile three

0:05:57.440,0:06:02.400
into the middle uh so tile three needs

0:05:59.840,0:06:03.759
to go to that position five

0:06:02.400,0:06:07.520
this step should hopefully be a pretty

0:06:03.759,0:06:09.360
easy step presuming it was not stuck

0:06:07.520,0:06:10.560
so now i've kind of got one two three

0:06:09.360,0:06:13.280
they're kind of like a train

0:06:10.560,0:06:13.840
right so this train is ready to to move

0:06:13.280,0:06:16.240
around

0:06:13.840,0:06:18.080
the station by the way if i ever go too

0:06:16.240,0:06:19.919
fast just pause the video that's the

0:06:18.080,0:06:22.000
advantage of videos

0:06:19.919,0:06:23.600
so now with the train ready to move

0:06:22.000,0:06:26.240
around the bin

0:06:23.600,0:06:28.479
you just need to one by one march the

0:06:26.240,0:06:30.560
tiles one two and three around

0:06:28.479,0:06:32.400
such that tiles one two and three are in

0:06:30.560,0:06:33.520
locations one two and three

0:06:32.400,0:06:36.080
so i'm gonna go ahead and do that so i'm

0:06:33.520,0:06:39.120
just going to kind of merge them around

0:06:36.080,0:06:41.840
march march march march march uh now

0:06:39.120,0:06:43.680
one two and three are all correct the

0:06:41.840,0:06:45.120
way this algorithm works is it's very

0:06:43.680,0:06:47.520
like procedural

0:06:45.120,0:06:49.360
and so now we just finished that row now

0:06:47.520,0:06:51.039
we're ready for the next row down

0:06:49.360,0:06:52.880
and again this this algorithm would work

0:06:51.039,0:06:54.720
no matter how big this was if it was a

0:06:52.880,0:06:56.400
four by four it would work just the same

0:06:54.720,0:06:58.479
right you just have these um

0:06:56.400,0:07:00.240
like two rows at a time so now we're

0:06:58.479,0:07:01.360
going to try to solve the next row four

0:07:00.240,0:07:03.039
five and six

0:07:01.360,0:07:05.360
and we're going to use the row below it

0:07:03.039,0:07:08.479
as kind of like a helper

0:07:05.360,0:07:11.360
and the first step is to get uh tile

0:07:08.479,0:07:11.919
four uh to the lower right corner this

0:07:11.360,0:07:13.440
is actually

0:07:11.919,0:07:16.160
the same kind of thing we did before so

0:07:13.440,0:07:18.479
like before tile one started in position

0:07:16.160,0:07:20.720
6. and so this kind of like starts in

0:07:18.479,0:07:22.800
the opposite corner right

0:07:20.720,0:07:24.080
make sure that tile 5 is not stuck in

0:07:22.800,0:07:25.680
location 6.

0:07:24.080,0:07:27.599
so i'm going to make sure tile 5 is way

0:07:25.680,0:07:30.080
over here which it is

0:07:27.599,0:07:31.520
and i'm going to put 4 in the corner

0:07:30.080,0:07:32.720
great so i've got four in the opposite

0:07:31.520,0:07:35.680
corner of where it's going

0:07:32.720,0:07:36.240
and i got five not stuck the next step

0:07:35.680,0:07:38.160
is to put

0:07:36.240,0:07:39.840
five next to four this is very similar

0:07:38.160,0:07:40.639
to what the the thing we did in the row

0:07:39.840,0:07:43.120
before

0:07:40.639,0:07:45.599
so i'm going to put five next to four

0:07:43.120,0:07:47.759
don't even care how it gets there

0:07:45.599,0:07:49.360
so now i've got four and five down here

0:07:47.759,0:07:52.560
on the bottom

0:07:49.360,0:07:52.560
campers you got that cut up

0:07:52.960,0:08:00.080
and then i'm gonna move four up

0:07:56.160,0:08:03.440
and five over so i've got to move

0:08:00.080,0:08:04.960
four up and five over so i've got four

0:08:03.440,0:08:05.919
and five like the train's ready to go

0:08:04.960,0:08:08.080
around

0:08:05.919,0:08:10.319
uh and then i've got got to get tile six

0:08:08.080,0:08:12.319
into location eight

0:08:10.319,0:08:13.440
so tile six into location eight that was

0:08:12.319,0:08:15.360
actually pretty easy

0:08:13.440,0:08:17.280
and my puzzle is almost done it looks

0:08:15.360,0:08:18.879
like gibberish but it is almost done

0:08:17.280,0:08:21.599
because the last thing i have to do is i

0:08:18.879,0:08:23.039
have to march tiles four five and six

0:08:21.599,0:08:26.000
around like a train

0:08:23.039,0:08:27.599
um and then the neat thing is is that

0:08:26.000,0:08:29.199
seven and eight are guaranteed to be

0:08:27.599,0:08:30.400
correct which is kind of just neat how

0:08:29.199,0:08:34.000
it works out right

0:08:30.400,0:08:34.000
so i'm going to march these around

0:08:34.159,0:08:38.320
and then you can see that i finished

0:08:39.039,0:08:42.640
so see if you can do the algorithm again

0:08:40.959,0:08:43.919
on your own i'm not going to walk

0:08:42.640,0:08:46.240
through it again

0:08:43.919,0:08:47.200
but i can hear my camper solving it over

0:08:46.240,0:08:49.279
there

0:08:47.200,0:08:51.120
but the the steps and you can pause them

0:08:49.279,0:08:54.160
as you need is to get

0:08:51.120,0:08:56.080
tile one to location six i'm making sure

0:08:54.160,0:08:59.040
that two is not stuck

0:08:56.080,0:09:00.240
get one and two together uh march one

0:08:59.040,0:09:03.440
and two up one making sure

0:09:00.240,0:09:04.880
three isn't stuck putting three on the

0:09:03.440,0:09:07.519
train wagon

0:09:04.880,0:09:08.000
and then marching around and then we do

0:09:07.519,0:09:09.839
the same thing

0:09:08.000,0:09:11.279
with the next row down we get four which

0:09:09.839,0:09:12.160
is gonna eventually be up here in the

0:09:11.279,0:09:14.880
corner

0:09:12.160,0:09:16.880
making sure five is not stuck get five

0:09:14.880,0:09:20.160
next to four

0:09:16.880,0:09:22.959
start marching around get six uh

0:09:20.160,0:09:24.240
in the train and then you'll solve the

0:09:22.959,0:09:26.720
puzzle

0:09:24.240,0:09:28.080
sound good all right so uh hopefully

0:09:26.720,0:09:29.920
you've practiced that algorithm and

0:09:28.080,0:09:31.440
you're able to uh to implement that

0:09:29.920,0:09:33.200
algorithm

0:09:31.440,0:09:34.959
and you're ready to actually get started

0:09:33.200,0:09:36.560
today so

0:09:34.959,0:09:38.959
what we're going to start with is a

0:09:36.560,0:09:42.959
choice and so this choice

0:09:38.959,0:09:44.800
is do you want to customize this puzzle

0:09:42.959,0:09:47.600
or do you want to just remix one that we

0:09:44.800,0:09:49.279
give you i would recommend that you try

0:09:47.600,0:09:50.560
to customize this puzzle just because

0:09:49.279,0:09:51.839
it's more fun

0:09:50.560,0:09:53.760
so at the end of the day you'll have

0:09:51.839,0:09:54.399
like your own image and your own slide

0:09:53.760,0:09:56.800
puzzle

0:09:54.399,0:09:58.480
and you won't just use mine by the way

0:09:56.800,0:10:01.440
these uh these two girls

0:09:58.480,0:10:02.640
these are bob's girls and so this is bob

0:10:01.440,0:10:03.600
schaefer's family that you're seeing

0:10:02.640,0:10:04.800
here

0:10:03.600,0:10:07.040
but i think it'd be fun if it was

0:10:04.800,0:10:08.959
actually like like your stuff

0:10:07.040,0:10:10.959
so what i would recommend you do is

0:10:08.959,0:10:11.440
option number one you find your own

0:10:10.959,0:10:14.240
image

0:10:11.440,0:10:16.320
so something that you want to uh to make

0:10:14.240,0:10:18.720
into a slide puzzle

0:10:16.320,0:10:20.160
eventually uh we're gonna need nine

0:10:18.720,0:10:21.519
tiles for this image and we're gonna

0:10:20.160,0:10:25.360
show you the steps for this

0:10:21.519,0:10:26.800
where each tile has to be um 120 pixels

0:10:25.360,0:10:29.600
by 120 pixels

0:10:26.800,0:10:30.160
it's okay if it's like 119 or 121 but it

0:10:29.600,0:10:31.680
should be

0:10:30.160,0:10:33.600
pretty close right and i'm going to show

0:10:31.680,0:10:35.120
you the steps for that that is what i

0:10:33.600,0:10:36.800
recommend you do

0:10:35.120,0:10:38.959
if you don't think that's going to be

0:10:36.800,0:10:40.720
fun you can always

0:10:38.959,0:10:43.680
click on this remix link and i'll make

0:10:40.720,0:10:45.519
this remix link available to you

0:10:43.680,0:10:47.200
and what you can do is when you click on

0:10:45.519,0:10:48.959
this link there'll be a big button up

0:10:47.200,0:10:49.440
here that says remix and you can remix

0:10:48.959,0:10:52.720
this

0:10:49.440,0:10:56.560
but it already has these steps done so

0:10:52.720,0:10:58.399
if you have trouble making your own

0:10:56.560,0:10:59.760
so that's option three try your best to

0:10:58.399,0:11:01.200
do option number one but then if it

0:10:59.760,0:11:04.399
fails do option number

0:11:01.200,0:11:06.640
number one right all right so let's

0:11:04.399,0:11:08.399
show you these steps so the first thing

0:11:06.640,0:11:10.480
you need to do is you need

0:11:08.399,0:11:11.680
some website tools so there's two steps

0:11:10.480,0:11:14.480
in this process

0:11:11.680,0:11:15.680
one step is to resize the image such

0:11:14.480,0:11:17.839
that when it's chopped up

0:11:15.680,0:11:19.519
each little tile is 120 by 120 so we

0:11:17.839,0:11:21.440
need to resize the image

0:11:19.519,0:11:23.440
and then the second step is to chop it

0:11:21.440,0:11:25.600
up so i've gone on the internet and i

0:11:23.440,0:11:28.720
found some tools that do these things

0:11:25.600,0:11:31.839
so the first tool is simple

0:11:28.720,0:11:33.839
image resizer so you can if you've got

0:11:31.839,0:11:35.680
the link you can just click on this link

0:11:33.839,0:11:37.200
but if you needed to you could just do a

0:11:35.680,0:11:40.560
google search for

0:11:37.200,0:11:42.760
simple image resizer

0:11:40.560,0:11:45.360
hopefully the top hit is

0:11:42.760,0:11:47.440
simpleimageresizer.com right

0:11:45.360,0:11:49.040
um and so on this website is where

0:11:47.440,0:11:51.920
you're going to select your image

0:11:49.040,0:11:52.720
so now you need uh to pick some image so

0:11:51.920,0:11:54.560
for me

0:11:52.720,0:11:55.920
um i've got a lot of different images

0:11:54.560,0:11:57.800
that i could use i

0:11:55.920,0:11:59.040
normally i would just go on to like

0:11:57.800,0:12:00.959
photos.google.com

0:11:59.040,0:12:02.240
and i would just like find some recent

0:12:00.959,0:12:03.760
photo that i've done here so here's a

0:12:02.240,0:12:04.720
cool one with uh keegan the dog

0:12:03.760,0:12:07.600
yesterday

0:12:04.720,0:12:09.040
um here's some from our recent birthday

0:12:07.600,0:12:10.880
party

0:12:09.040,0:12:12.560
um and so you should somehow for you

0:12:10.880,0:12:13.519
find one of these images

0:12:12.560,0:12:15.680
i'll tell you what i'll just go ahead

0:12:13.519,0:12:16.959
and click on one of these make sure my

0:12:15.680,0:12:20.000
wife looks good in it

0:12:16.959,0:12:21.279
and click download and so i'm going to

0:12:20.000,0:12:24.880
save this into

0:12:21.279,0:12:26.639
uh fisher birthday so now i've got

0:12:24.880,0:12:29.040
my image that i'm using you should do

0:12:26.639,0:12:30.880
your own thing to get your image

0:12:29.040,0:12:32.480
and then you're going to go into simple

0:12:30.880,0:12:34.000
image resizer and you're going to say

0:12:32.480,0:12:37.600
select image

0:12:34.000,0:12:40.079
and so mine was called fisher birthday

0:12:37.600,0:12:41.360
and you're going to upload it now i was

0:12:40.079,0:12:42.959
a little fast

0:12:41.360,0:12:45.279
because i should have known something

0:12:42.959,0:12:48.160
about this image before i got this far

0:12:45.279,0:12:48.560
i should know which dimension is smaller

0:12:48.160,0:12:50.399
so

0:12:48.560,0:12:52.800
in this picture this is a landscape

0:12:50.399,0:12:54.000
picture the smaller dimension is the

0:12:52.800,0:12:56.000
height

0:12:54.000,0:12:57.839
and so whichever dimension is smaller

0:12:56.000,0:12:58.160
you need to get that in your head so for

0:12:57.839,0:13:00.959
me

0:12:58.160,0:13:01.680
it's height so on this tool i'm going to

0:13:00.959,0:13:03.040
say

0:13:01.680,0:13:04.800
there's a radio for percentage or

0:13:03.040,0:13:06.720
dimension i want to mention

0:13:04.800,0:13:08.160
and then whichever of your dimensions is

0:13:06.720,0:13:10.639
smaller make that one three

0:13:08.160,0:13:12.079
six zero so if you've got a portrait

0:13:10.639,0:13:14.240
image make your width

0:13:12.079,0:13:15.440
three six zero if you've got a landscape

0:13:14.240,0:13:17.279
image like me

0:13:15.440,0:13:18.639
uh so again this is my landscape image

0:13:17.279,0:13:20.160
so the height is smaller

0:13:18.639,0:13:21.760
so i want the smaller dimension to be

0:13:20.160,0:13:23.200
360. and the reason for that is that way

0:13:21.760,0:13:25.760
the other dimension is guaranteed to be

0:13:23.200,0:13:29.040
something bigger right which is good

0:13:25.760,0:13:31.760
and then you click on resize

0:13:29.040,0:13:33.279
and then you said it's been resized and

0:13:31.760,0:13:35.360
then it says click here to download it

0:13:33.279,0:13:36.800
so you click on this download button

0:13:35.360,0:13:38.639
now strangely it doesn't actually

0:13:36.800,0:13:39.519
download it like wouldn't you think that

0:13:38.639,0:13:41.279
a download button

0:13:39.519,0:13:42.480
would download it raise your hand over

0:13:41.279,0:13:43.440
there campers if you think download

0:13:42.480,0:13:45.760
should download it

0:13:43.440,0:13:46.480
it doesn't it opens it in a new tab in

0:13:45.760,0:13:48.639
chrome

0:13:46.480,0:13:50.000
it does resize it which is good but now

0:13:48.639,0:13:51.360
you need to download it so i'm going to

0:13:50.000,0:13:54.880
right click on it

0:13:51.360,0:13:57.360
and i'm going to say save image as

0:13:54.880,0:13:59.639
um and so this uh got the same name

0:13:57.360,0:14:03.199
fisher birthday and then it added this

0:13:59.639,0:14:04.639
x360 so that looks good

0:14:03.199,0:14:06.800
so there are a lot of steps in this

0:14:04.639,0:14:08.480
process but i do want you to try it

0:14:06.800,0:14:11.040
there's a lot of like working with your

0:14:08.480,0:14:12.880
computer and saving things

0:14:11.040,0:14:14.079
so you might get an adult to help you as

0:14:12.880,0:14:16.000
well

0:14:14.079,0:14:17.519
all right so step number one resizing

0:14:16.000,0:14:20.560
the image is done

0:14:17.519,0:14:22.480
it has a height of exactly 360 or a

0:14:20.560,0:14:24.800
width of exactly 360

0:14:22.480,0:14:26.560
and then the other dimension is bigger

0:14:24.800,0:14:27.920
the next thing we need to do is we need

0:14:26.560,0:14:30.160
to uh

0:14:27.920,0:14:31.199
chop it up right so this is my my slides

0:14:30.160,0:14:33.600
that showed what

0:14:31.199,0:14:35.839
what did with the resize to chop it up

0:14:33.600,0:14:38.720
uh there's a tool that i found called

0:14:35.839,0:14:40.560
postcron all one word postcron i have no

0:14:38.720,0:14:44.000
idea what postcron stands for

0:14:40.560,0:14:45.040
image splitter so let's go uh over into

0:14:44.000,0:14:48.240
chrome

0:14:45.040,0:14:51.920
uh and let's do a search for post cron

0:14:48.240,0:14:52.399
uh image splitter hopefully your first

0:14:51.920,0:14:56.240
hit

0:14:52.399,0:14:58.560
is postcron.com slash image splitter

0:14:56.240,0:14:59.839
uh and it takes you to this place and

0:14:58.560,0:15:02.160
what you need to do is you need to

0:14:59.839,0:15:02.639
upload that image that you just resized

0:15:02.160,0:15:05.680
right

0:15:02.639,0:15:07.199
so upload image uh looks like i kind of

0:15:05.680,0:15:08.160
have to click on it twice so i have to

0:15:07.199,0:15:09.199
click on uh

0:15:08.160,0:15:11.560
the first one that i have to click on

0:15:09.199,0:15:14.560
the second one and you should have this

0:15:11.560,0:15:14.560
x360

0:15:15.040,0:15:18.480
now what you're going to do this is the

0:15:16.320,0:15:18.880
hardest part is you're going to make

0:15:18.480,0:15:22.240
this

0:15:18.880,0:15:24.320
grid completely fill your image

0:15:22.240,0:15:25.839
so here's what i like to do if you grab

0:15:24.320,0:15:27.360
it just kind of like in the middle you

0:15:25.839,0:15:32.560
can move it around

0:15:27.360,0:15:34.639
we want this grid to be exactly 360 tall

0:15:32.560,0:15:35.839
or 360 wide just whichever it is it

0:15:34.639,0:15:37.839
wants to be a perfect square

0:15:35.839,0:15:39.600
if your image is like mine and it's

0:15:37.839,0:15:40.079
landscape i'm just going to kind of put

0:15:39.600,0:15:41.920
it

0:15:40.079,0:15:43.920
right at the top so i'm going to place

0:15:41.920,0:15:45.440
like this upper left-hand corner

0:15:43.920,0:15:46.480
if you're if your image is portrait

0:15:45.440,0:15:47.680
you're going to have to like slam it

0:15:46.480,0:15:49.279
over to the side right but i'm going to

0:15:47.680,0:15:51.759
slam mine right to the top

0:15:49.279,0:15:54.000
and then to take the other corner and as

0:15:51.759,0:15:57.040
accurately as you can make it go right

0:15:54.000,0:15:58.240
on the very very bottom now this is

0:15:57.040,0:16:00.639
tricky

0:15:58.240,0:16:02.959
you can go short that's obvious but you

0:16:00.639,0:16:04.399
can also go too long so see i went too

0:16:02.959,0:16:05.360
long here and i got these like green

0:16:04.399,0:16:07.920
things down here

0:16:05.360,0:16:09.519
so i want to go exactly on the bottom

0:16:07.920,0:16:10.720
and so if you get it perfect you can see

0:16:09.519,0:16:12.399
like right now there's little bitty

0:16:10.720,0:16:13.759
green nubbins out there

0:16:12.399,0:16:15.759
you can see how old i am how i had to

0:16:13.759,0:16:18.079
get closer to my computer

0:16:15.759,0:16:18.959
if you get it absolutely perfect then

0:16:18.079,0:16:22.800
you're going to get

0:16:18.959,0:16:23.120
um 120 by 120. if you're off a little

0:16:22.800,0:16:24.480
bit

0:16:23.120,0:16:27.199
you're gonna get something close which

0:16:24.480,0:16:28.720
will work fine but i'm going for perfect

0:16:27.199,0:16:30.880
another thing that is annoying is you

0:16:28.720,0:16:32.480
might um have trouble with your picture

0:16:30.880,0:16:33.759
so you can see how like keegan's face

0:16:32.480,0:16:35.199
and bowen's face kind of like barely

0:16:33.759,0:16:37.120
made this

0:16:35.199,0:16:38.160
feature right so if you if you don't

0:16:37.120,0:16:39.600
like how it's laying out pick a

0:16:38.160,0:16:41.279
different picture

0:16:39.600,0:16:43.199
as soon as you're done click on split

0:16:41.279,0:16:45.920
image

0:16:43.199,0:16:47.600
and then you click on download image

0:16:45.920,0:16:49.120
this time download image really does

0:16:47.600,0:16:52.079
download image

0:16:49.120,0:16:53.519
so i'm going to call this fisher

0:16:52.079,0:16:57.040
birthday

0:16:53.519,0:16:57.519
images what it's going to give you is a

0:16:57.040,0:17:01.279
zip

0:16:57.519,0:17:03.360
file if you've done a lot with computers

0:17:01.279,0:17:05.039
you're probably comfortable with zips if

0:17:03.360,0:17:06.799
you're new to computers you're probably

0:17:05.039,0:17:09.919
new to zips as well

0:17:06.799,0:17:10.880
but what a zip file is is it's all your

0:17:09.919,0:17:13.919
files

0:17:10.880,0:17:17.120
packaged together really tightly

0:17:13.919,0:17:19.120
now um sorry there's a lot of steps

0:17:17.120,0:17:20.240
this is the easiest method i could find

0:17:19.120,0:17:21.600
for you right

0:17:20.240,0:17:23.919
so the next thing you need to do is you

0:17:21.600,0:17:25.919
need to extract all on the zip

0:17:23.919,0:17:27.439
so on a windows computer you'll have to

0:17:25.919,0:17:28.640
find it in finder

0:17:27.439,0:17:30.799
and there should hopefully be a button

0:17:28.640,0:17:32.400
that says extract all

0:17:30.799,0:17:33.840
on other computers you'll just have to

0:17:32.400,0:17:35.039
double click on it on my mac i just

0:17:33.840,0:17:36.559
double click on it

0:17:35.039,0:17:38.240
and what it should do is it should chop

0:17:36.559,0:17:41.120
your image up into nine

0:17:38.240,0:17:41.919
uh tiles so you can see that i did

0:17:41.120,0:17:45.840
pretty good

0:17:41.919,0:17:46.960
um so each of mine is exactly 120 so i

0:17:45.840,0:17:48.720
nailed it

0:17:46.960,0:17:50.320
on that on that previous step where like

0:17:48.720,0:17:52.480
i was setting the size

0:17:50.320,0:17:53.600
it's going to take you a couple of tries

0:17:52.480,0:17:56.320
so

0:17:53.600,0:17:58.000
i nailed mine i got them all at exactly

0:17:56.320,0:18:00.080
120.

0:17:58.000,0:18:01.200
the order by the way is sometimes crazy

0:18:00.080,0:18:03.039
uh so it looks like

0:18:01.200,0:18:05.360
tile one is actually the lower right

0:18:03.039,0:18:05.840
corner um and then it goes across the

0:18:05.360,0:18:09.280
bottom

0:18:05.840,0:18:11.120
for two three and then four

0:18:09.280,0:18:13.600
five six and then the top row is going

0:18:11.120,0:18:16.000
to be seven hey that's a handsome guy

0:18:13.600,0:18:17.280
8 and 9 at the top it's actually

0:18:16.000,0:18:19.120
numbered

0:18:17.280,0:18:20.559
backwards of what i want we're going to

0:18:19.120,0:18:22.559
have to deal with that later

0:18:20.559,0:18:24.160
all right so take as long as you need to

0:18:22.559,0:18:26.000
try to get that figured out

0:18:24.160,0:18:27.679
once you've got your nine images then

0:18:26.000,0:18:29.440
you're ready to get started right so

0:18:27.679,0:18:31.360
it's like we haven't even started yet dr

0:18:29.440,0:18:35.919
fisher you're killing me

0:18:31.360,0:18:39.919
so go to scratch.mit.edu

0:18:35.919,0:18:40.480
create a new project so longest setup

0:18:39.919,0:18:41.679
ever

0:18:40.480,0:18:44.480
but it's going to be worth it because

0:18:41.679,0:18:46.160
it's cool all right so i am

0:18:44.480,0:18:48.160
really hoping that people are successful

0:18:46.160,0:18:50.640
with their images i kind of expect

0:18:48.160,0:18:51.600
that um the ta office hours like you can

0:18:50.640,0:18:53.919
join the zoom meeting

0:18:51.600,0:18:55.520
it's going to just light up today with

0:18:53.919,0:18:57.440
people that need help with these steps

0:18:55.520,0:18:58.559
um that's okay we'll try to make sure

0:18:57.440,0:19:01.039
there's extra people

0:18:58.559,0:19:03.280
on board for today so uh what i'm gonna

0:19:01.039,0:19:04.480
do is i'm gonna actually keep the cat

0:19:03.280,0:19:06.080
i know everybody's expecting me to

0:19:04.480,0:19:06.559
delete the cat right off but i'm just

0:19:06.080,0:19:08.480
gonna

0:19:06.559,0:19:10.640
keep the cat i'm gonna go into his

0:19:08.480,0:19:13.360
costumes and i'm going to add

0:19:10.640,0:19:13.919
my images as different costumes and then

0:19:13.360,0:19:15.600
eventually

0:19:13.919,0:19:17.679
i'm going to delete the cat costumes but

0:19:15.600,0:19:20.080
i'm just going to keep the cat

0:19:17.679,0:19:21.360
and just come over here and say choose a

0:19:20.080,0:19:24.640
costume

0:19:21.360,0:19:25.919
and i'm going to click on upload costume

0:19:24.640,0:19:28.400
now what i want to do is i want to go

0:19:25.919,0:19:29.760
into that extracted zip file

0:19:28.400,0:19:32.480
which has like my one two three four

0:19:29.760,0:19:35.679
five six seven eight nine and i want to

0:19:32.480,0:19:37.520
bring in all nine as different costumes

0:19:35.679,0:19:38.640
of the cat

0:19:37.520,0:19:40.320
then what i want to do is i want to

0:19:38.640,0:19:42.320
delete the cat because i don't really

0:19:40.320,0:19:44.799
need his images

0:19:42.320,0:19:46.400
and so now i've got all these images in

0:19:44.799,0:19:48.000
here which is cool so you should have

0:19:46.400,0:19:49.200
nine total

0:19:48.000,0:19:51.120
and i'm going to do some some

0:19:49.200,0:19:52.559
organization and clean up the first

0:19:51.120,0:19:53.200
thing i want to do is i want them all to

0:19:52.559,0:19:55.440
be

0:19:53.200,0:19:56.240
vectors so in every single one i'm going

0:19:55.440,0:19:58.240
to click on

0:19:56.240,0:20:00.400
convert to vector so i'm just going to

0:19:58.240,0:20:02.159
do that first

0:20:00.400,0:20:03.919
while i'm doing it i'm going to explain

0:20:02.159,0:20:06.159
what i'm doing so

0:20:03.919,0:20:07.520
with scratch there's two different

0:20:06.159,0:20:10.320
drawing modes there's

0:20:07.520,0:20:12.159
bitmap mode and then there's vector mode

0:20:10.320,0:20:13.760
vector mode is the newer mode

0:20:12.159,0:20:15.440
and in general you should use the newer

0:20:13.760,0:20:17.679
mode

0:20:15.440,0:20:18.960
but it lets you like add something and

0:20:17.679,0:20:20.720
then edit it later

0:20:18.960,0:20:22.960
bitmap mode does not let you edit it

0:20:20.720,0:20:24.080
later so that's why i like vector mode

0:20:22.960,0:20:25.840
the next thing i'm going to do is i'm

0:20:24.080,0:20:26.480
going to figure out what order my images

0:20:25.840,0:20:29.039
are in

0:20:26.480,0:20:30.320
so mine came in where number one is the

0:20:29.039,0:20:33.520
lower right corner

0:20:30.320,0:20:35.520
so it's like 1-1 and then it's

0:20:33.520,0:20:37.200
moving across the bottom i know my image

0:20:35.520,0:20:39.280
so this is like the bottom middle

0:20:37.200,0:20:40.720
and then this is the bottom left and

0:20:39.280,0:20:42.480
then it's the the right

0:20:40.720,0:20:44.240
on the middle row and then the middle

0:20:42.480,0:20:46.799
middle uh and then the left so i know

0:20:44.240,0:20:49.919
the order that mine come in

0:20:46.799,0:20:50.880
um and strangely it's backwards of what

0:20:49.919,0:20:54.159
i wanted right

0:20:50.880,0:20:56.559
so the upper left hand corner in my mind

0:20:54.159,0:20:58.000
is location one so i've kind of got it

0:20:56.559,0:20:58.480
on the board here so i think of this as

0:20:58.000,0:21:02.320
like

0:20:58.480,0:21:05.760
number one number two number three four

0:21:02.320,0:21:08.000
five six seven eight nine

0:21:05.760,0:21:09.200
so before we get into the code i'm gonna

0:21:08.000,0:21:10.720
do a couple things

0:21:09.200,0:21:12.960
first i'm gonna put a number i'm gonna

0:21:10.720,0:21:16.640
actually put that number on the image

0:21:12.960,0:21:19.039
so the way i do that is i click on text

0:21:16.640,0:21:19.679
i decide what color i want to use for my

0:21:19.039,0:21:21.360
number

0:21:19.679,0:21:22.960
it defaults to purple but you don't have

0:21:21.360,0:21:23.679
to use purple you can use any color you

0:21:22.960,0:21:27.039
want

0:21:23.679,0:21:28.720
i'll make mine red for example

0:21:27.039,0:21:30.799
and then i click in here and then i just

0:21:28.720,0:21:32.640
type a number one

0:21:30.799,0:21:34.640
now the nice thing about vector mode is

0:21:32.640,0:21:36.480
that i can like edit this later and it's

0:21:34.640,0:21:37.360
not like squished into my picture so i'm

0:21:36.480,0:21:39.120
going to get it

0:21:37.360,0:21:40.480
to right there which i think is where i

0:21:39.120,0:21:42.880
want it

0:21:40.480,0:21:43.840
now i numbered this one number one

0:21:42.880,0:21:46.480
because i know my

0:21:43.840,0:21:48.240
image and i know that this is the upper

0:21:46.480,0:21:49.039
left hand corner and so i put a one on

0:21:48.240,0:21:50.080
it

0:21:49.039,0:21:52.159
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:21:50.080,0:21:53.200
number all the other pictures the way i

0:21:52.159,0:21:57.039
choose to do it

0:21:53.200,0:22:00.000
is i choose to uh copy this i use ctrl

0:21:57.039,0:22:01.039
c and then i go to my one that's going

0:22:00.000,0:22:04.000
to be two

0:22:01.039,0:22:05.760
i paste it on there and then i change

0:22:04.000,0:22:07.520
the one to a two but i like to do that

0:22:05.760,0:22:09.520
because then it shows up in exactly the

0:22:07.520,0:22:11.200
same position every time

0:22:09.520,0:22:13.760
so it takes just a little bit of work to

0:22:11.200,0:22:15.280
do this so i go through each and every

0:22:13.760,0:22:17.120
one

0:22:15.280,0:22:18.320
you can pause the video of course as you

0:22:17.120,0:22:20.720
need

0:22:18.320,0:22:23.520
but they should be in order but they

0:22:20.720,0:22:26.720
might be in backwards order

0:22:23.520,0:22:28.080
strangely i've tried this on mac i've

0:22:26.720,0:22:29.679
tried it on windows i've tried it on

0:22:28.080,0:22:32.480
linux i've tried on chromebook

0:22:29.679,0:22:34.640
chromebook comes in a different order

0:22:32.480,0:22:36.240
than all the others

0:22:34.640,0:22:37.600
so that's why we kind of have to do this

0:22:36.240,0:22:40.960
manually because yours might have come

0:22:37.600,0:22:42.880
in a different a different order right

0:22:40.960,0:22:44.640
all right so i'm almost done with mine

0:22:42.880,0:22:46.640
uh bottom to top

0:22:44.640,0:22:48.240
um after i finish the task i'm going to

0:22:46.640,0:22:50.080
have to go back and check it

0:22:48.240,0:22:51.520
just to make sure that it that it all

0:22:50.080,0:22:55.919
looks right

0:22:51.520,0:22:59.200
all right so 9 is my lower right corner

0:22:55.919,0:23:02.720
and then oops so there's 9 8

0:22:59.200,0:23:06.799
7 6 5

0:23:02.720,0:23:09.360
4 3 2 1.

0:23:06.799,0:23:10.720
great so that's important the next thing

0:23:09.360,0:23:12.400
that i'm going to change is i'm going to

0:23:10.720,0:23:15.840
choose to change

0:23:12.400,0:23:18.640
the um name of the costume

0:23:15.840,0:23:19.840
so right now mine says 9 up here but

0:23:18.640,0:23:23.600
this is really

0:23:19.840,0:23:25.760
tile 1. being sneaky i'm going to copy

0:23:23.600,0:23:26.400
the word tile to my clipboard with ctrl

0:23:25.760,0:23:27.600
c

0:23:26.400,0:23:29.520
campers will help you do this in a

0:23:27.600,0:23:31.520
minute and i'm going to change the names

0:23:29.520,0:23:33.919
of all these

0:23:31.520,0:23:35.520
to a more logical name right so this i'm

0:23:33.919,0:23:40.000
going to call this image

0:23:35.520,0:23:41.440
tile 3 i'm going to call this tile 4.

0:23:40.000,0:23:42.960
i think you kind of see the pattern the

0:23:41.440,0:23:44.799
only one that actually succeeded was

0:23:42.960,0:23:48.080
tile 5. it's the only one

0:23:44.799,0:23:51.200
that actually had a reasonable name

0:23:48.080,0:23:54.400
and so now the names of all my images

0:23:51.200,0:23:57.600
uh match and they're appropriate um

0:23:54.400,0:24:00.400
and i do that because i'm ocd um

0:23:57.600,0:24:02.159
that actually has no value at all

0:24:00.400,0:24:03.520
because we we're never gonna refer to

0:24:02.159,0:24:05.760
them by their name

0:24:03.520,0:24:07.120
we're going to only refer to them by

0:24:05.760,0:24:09.679
their index

0:24:07.120,0:24:11.200
and the index is also backwards so what

0:24:09.679,0:24:12.400
i want to do is i want to drag these

0:24:11.200,0:24:13.600
around so you can see that this is

0:24:12.400,0:24:16.320
number nine

0:24:13.600,0:24:18.080
it needs to go to the very very bottom

0:24:16.320,0:24:19.679
you probably have to kind of move it in

0:24:18.080,0:24:20.880
two steps so like you kind of move it

0:24:19.679,0:24:22.240
about halfway

0:24:20.880,0:24:23.600
uh and then you move the rest away but i

0:24:22.240,0:24:24.480
can see that tile nine is down on the

0:24:23.600,0:24:27.039
bottom

0:24:24.480,0:24:27.760
uh tile one uh needs to come to the very

0:24:27.039,0:24:29.360
top

0:24:27.760,0:24:31.760
uh probably gonna have to do that in two

0:24:29.360,0:24:33.679
steps uh nope i got it up to where it's

0:24:31.760,0:24:37.600
in the top

0:24:33.679,0:24:40.159
so go back and forth and get your tiles

0:24:37.600,0:24:41.440
to the correct places

0:24:40.159,0:24:43.200
and so hopefully you'll kind of get a

0:24:41.440,0:24:44.880
little pattern going and it won't be too

0:24:43.200,0:24:46.559
bad

0:24:44.880,0:24:48.720
but make sure that it actually is in the

0:24:46.559,0:24:49.520
correct order so now my tile one is at

0:24:48.720,0:24:51.279
the top

0:24:49.520,0:24:53.120
it's called tile one and it's got a one

0:24:51.279,0:24:57.600
here tile two

0:24:53.120,0:25:01.600
uh all good three four

0:24:57.600,0:25:04.799
five 6 7

0:25:01.600,0:25:07.120
8 and 9. so

0:25:04.799,0:25:08.400
pause the video take as long as you need

0:25:07.120,0:25:10.080
to do that

0:25:08.400,0:25:11.840
and let's definitely save it because

0:25:10.080,0:25:14.640
that was a lot of work so this i'm going

0:25:11.840,0:25:16.000
to call my slide puzzle

0:25:14.640,0:25:18.320
all right i'm going to help my campers

0:25:16.000,0:25:20.400
out hopefully everybody can get this

0:25:18.320,0:25:21.919
up and running expect a lot of questions

0:25:20.400,0:25:25.200
at the zoom office hours today

0:25:21.919,0:25:26.559
that's okay all right so i had to help

0:25:25.200,0:25:27.679
my campers out a little bit there that

0:25:26.559,0:25:28.880
was no surprise

0:25:27.679,0:25:30.720
getting their numbers on and getting

0:25:28.880,0:25:33.279
their tiles renamed and things like that

0:25:30.720,0:25:34.559
again uh do keep in mind uh that if it's

0:25:33.279,0:25:37.520
going badly for you

0:25:34.559,0:25:38.080
um you can always uh remix this project

0:25:37.520,0:25:39.600
uh to

0:25:38.080,0:25:40.640
to just use it right it already had the

0:25:39.600,0:25:42.080
numbers in it already had them

0:25:40.640,0:25:43.840
rearranged things like that

0:25:42.080,0:25:45.840
love for you to be able to do your own

0:25:43.840,0:25:47.039
it goes badly use the remix instead of

0:25:45.840,0:25:48.720
giving up on the day right

0:25:47.039,0:25:50.720
that's kind of what i would say there

0:25:48.720,0:25:53.440
all right so uh now we're ready to go

0:25:50.720,0:25:54.960
um so you can leave whichever costume

0:25:53.440,0:25:56.000
selected you want it honestly doesn't

0:25:54.960,0:25:58.480
matter it's going to show up over

0:25:56.000,0:26:00.080
here but that honestly doesn't matter uh

0:25:58.480,0:26:02.799
and we're ready to uh to hop

0:26:00.080,0:26:03.360
into the code uh we're going to be doing

0:26:02.799,0:26:05.840
code

0:26:03.360,0:26:07.440
on uh this one sprite that we have which

0:26:05.840,0:26:08.559
is currently called sprite1

0:26:07.440,0:26:10.640
i don't like that name i'm going to

0:26:08.559,0:26:12.480
rename him to tile

0:26:10.640,0:26:14.799
so i just like that name better so now

0:26:12.480,0:26:15.679
he's named tile

0:26:14.799,0:26:18.720
and what we're going to do is we're

0:26:15.679,0:26:21.039
going to do some code on this sprite

0:26:18.720,0:26:22.400
and then some code on the backdrop and

0:26:21.039,0:26:24.000
just like our previous games we're going

0:26:22.400,0:26:26.080
to make use of clones really

0:26:24.000,0:26:27.840
heavily because we're just going to have

0:26:26.080,0:26:29.600
this one tile that has different images

0:26:27.840,0:26:31.679
it's going to be really creative

0:26:29.600,0:26:34.000
by the way the backdrop if you want you

0:26:31.679,0:26:36.240
can choose to leave it white

0:26:34.000,0:26:38.400
or you can actually add an image back

0:26:36.240,0:26:39.520
here the backdrop doesn't really affect

0:26:38.400,0:26:40.720
anything i always kind of like this

0:26:39.520,0:26:41.919
heart one right so i'm going to put a

0:26:40.720,0:26:45.120
heart back there

0:26:41.919,0:26:47.600
just because it like shows love right

0:26:45.120,0:26:48.720
backdrop completely optional i choose to

0:26:47.600,0:26:50.799
stick one on

0:26:48.720,0:26:51.840
uh let's go ahead and start into the

0:26:50.799,0:26:53.600
code

0:26:51.840,0:26:55.039
that's happening on the the backdrop

0:26:53.600,0:26:56.640
sometimes i call it a backdrop sometimes

0:26:55.039,0:26:58.559
i call it a stage

0:26:56.640,0:27:00.320
so our first goal here is going to be

0:26:58.559,0:27:01.520
very similar to what we did with the

0:27:00.320,0:27:03.840
lawnmower

0:27:01.520,0:27:04.559
so we're going to try to plant all these

0:27:03.840,0:27:06.960
things

0:27:04.559,0:27:08.000
so that forms a grid so if you remember

0:27:06.960,0:27:08.799
the lawn mower

0:27:08.000,0:27:11.520
the first thing we did with the

0:27:08.799,0:27:14.400
lawnmowers we did a bunch of math right

0:27:11.520,0:27:15.760
this one the math is easier so each of

0:27:14.400,0:27:20.159
these tiles

0:27:15.760,0:27:23.600
is exactly 120 across so this way is 120

0:27:20.159,0:27:25.120
uh and then this way is 120 as well

0:27:23.600,0:27:26.640
um and it turns out that you're going to

0:27:25.120,0:27:27.760
need to know where the centers are of

0:27:26.640,0:27:29.840
each tile

0:27:27.760,0:27:31.679
um and so if this is 120 and then this

0:27:29.840,0:27:32.480
is 120 then the distance from here to

0:27:31.679,0:27:36.000
there

0:27:32.480,0:27:38.960
is 60. uh and then the distance from

0:27:36.000,0:27:40.159
here to there is 60. by the way it looks

0:27:38.960,0:27:41.360
like there's a little gap in here but

0:27:40.159,0:27:41.919
there's not they're actually smushed

0:27:41.360,0:27:43.440
together

0:27:41.919,0:27:45.640
uh so camper is the easiest question of

0:27:43.440,0:27:49.200
the day what's 60 plus 60

0:27:45.640,0:27:50.320
110 120 uh and then this one's just

0:27:49.200,0:27:52.320
right at zero

0:27:50.320,0:27:53.919
uh and then this one is down so it's

0:27:52.320,0:27:56.480
actually negative 60

0:27:53.919,0:27:57.440
um plus a negative 60. so what's this

0:27:56.480,0:28:00.000
one down here

0:27:57.440,0:28:01.360
negative 100 negative 120 and then the

0:28:00.000,0:28:03.440
math this direction kind of works the

0:28:01.360,0:28:06.799
same so you've got a negative 120

0:28:03.440,0:28:09.200
a zero and a positive 120. so the math

0:28:06.799,0:28:11.919
is actually much easier this time

0:28:09.200,0:28:15.279
because the centers of these things it's

0:28:11.919,0:28:18.640
either at like negative 120 positive 120

0:28:15.279,0:28:21.200
or 0 positive 120

0:28:18.640,0:28:23.200
but it's always like 0 or 120 or a

0:28:21.200,0:28:25.279
negative 120. so the math is easier

0:28:23.200,0:28:26.559
so let's go ahead and see if we can do

0:28:25.279,0:28:27.600
some of the tricks that we did with

0:28:26.559,0:28:29.600
lawnmower

0:28:27.600,0:28:31.279
on the backdrop so the first thing we

0:28:29.600,0:28:32.399
need is we need a couple variables if

0:28:31.279,0:28:35.279
you remember how the

0:28:32.399,0:28:36.640
how the graphs worked we need a variable

0:28:35.279,0:28:39.679
i'm going to call this one the

0:28:36.640,0:28:41.039
placement x

0:28:39.679,0:28:42.559
interestingly whenever you're on the

0:28:41.039,0:28:43.520
backdrop it doesn't even give you that

0:28:42.559,0:28:45.120
choice of like

0:28:43.520,0:28:46.320
should it be just for this sprite or

0:28:45.120,0:28:47.520
should it be for all sprites if you're

0:28:46.320,0:28:48.320
on the backdrop it's always for

0:28:47.520,0:28:49.600
everybody

0:28:48.320,0:28:51.679
so i'm going to make a variable called

0:28:49.600,0:28:53.360
placement x

0:28:51.679,0:28:56.000
i'll make another variable called

0:28:53.360,0:28:57.679
placement y

0:28:56.000,0:29:00.159
and if you remember the trick that we

0:28:57.679,0:29:01.360
used with lawnmower is we kind of like

0:29:00.159,0:29:02.799
set these variables

0:29:01.360,0:29:05.520
uh to like where it was going to get

0:29:02.799,0:29:07.200
placed then we made a clone

0:29:05.520,0:29:09.440
and then we moved the clone to that

0:29:07.200,0:29:12.799
variable you remember that

0:29:09.440,0:29:14.240
you remember that campers all right

0:29:12.799,0:29:15.840
um so we need a placement x and

0:29:14.240,0:29:16.640
placement y and this time we need one

0:29:15.840,0:29:20.240
more

0:29:16.640,0:29:24.320
we need to know what costume number

0:29:20.240,0:29:25.760
we need costume i misspelt

0:29:24.320,0:29:27.440
again you can see that my preferred

0:29:25.760,0:29:29.520
naming convention for variables that i'm

0:29:27.440,0:29:33.520
gonna hide is this camel case

0:29:29.520,0:29:35.840
um and so our goal is um on the backdrop

0:29:33.520,0:29:37.279
um let's start by placing just this top

0:29:35.840,0:29:38.640
one in the corner

0:29:37.279,0:29:40.399
and then we'll place the whole row and

0:29:38.640,0:29:41.919
then we'll place the whole grid right

0:29:40.399,0:29:44.880
so what i want to do is i want to go to

0:29:41.919,0:29:46.399
events when green flag clicked

0:29:44.880,0:29:47.919
so no shock we're going to start with

0:29:46.399,0:29:50.720
the win green flag click that's how we

0:29:47.919,0:29:53.039
start like every program

0:29:50.720,0:29:54.720
and we're going to set these variables

0:29:53.039,0:29:57.279
so i'm going to drag over three set

0:29:54.720,0:29:57.279
commands

0:29:57.760,0:30:02.720
and the first one i'm going to set the

0:29:59.120,0:30:05.279
placement x and then the placement y

0:30:02.720,0:30:07.200
and then the costume number so for this

0:30:05.279,0:30:08.960
very first one see if you can figure out

0:30:07.200,0:30:10.320
how you would set these three things so

0:30:08.960,0:30:11.440
how are you going to set placement x how

0:30:10.320,0:30:12.880
are you going to set placement y and how

0:30:11.440,0:30:14.480
you're going to set the cost remember

0:30:12.880,0:30:16.960
take a minute and see if you can do it

0:30:14.480,0:30:16.960
on your own

0:30:17.120,0:30:20.159
all right so my campers actually did

0:30:18.559,0:30:24.080
pretty good with it uh so the

0:30:20.159,0:30:25.679
x is negative 120 the y is positive 120

0:30:24.080,0:30:27.200
and this is going to be costume number

0:30:25.679,0:30:29.200
one

0:30:27.200,0:30:30.480
um and then what i like to do is i like

0:30:29.200,0:30:31.520
to just because we had this problem with

0:30:30.480,0:30:33.440
the lawnmower

0:30:31.520,0:30:35.520
is oh i like to make the clone i need to

0:30:33.440,0:30:36.640
make that first right so create clone of

0:30:35.520,0:30:39.679
tile

0:30:36.640,0:30:41.279
and then i like to have a short delay

0:30:39.679,0:30:42.960
i don't know if this short delay is

0:30:41.279,0:30:45.520
actually necessary this time

0:30:42.960,0:30:46.640
it was for the lawnmower and so i'm just

0:30:45.520,0:30:48.320
going to stick it on right so i'm just

0:30:46.640,0:30:50.000
going to put a short delay after i place

0:30:48.320,0:30:51.840
a tile

0:30:50.000,0:30:54.080
if i run this code right now nothing's

0:30:51.840,0:30:56.559
going to happen because my tile

0:30:54.080,0:30:59.039
doesn't actually use these variables so

0:30:56.559,0:31:00.880
let's go into our tile code

0:30:59.039,0:31:02.559
and let's actually write a little bit

0:31:00.880,0:31:05.600
over here

0:31:02.559,0:31:07.120
so our tile code is going to be when i

0:31:05.600,0:31:08.640
start as clone

0:31:07.120,0:31:10.240
so i've kind of seen this pattern a few

0:31:08.640,0:31:12.880
times

0:31:10.240,0:31:14.240
that you when you're clone you don't

0:31:12.880,0:31:15.919
care about the green flag you care about

0:31:14.240,0:31:17.200
when i start his clone

0:31:15.919,0:31:19.760
and what he's going to do is he's going

0:31:17.200,0:31:21.919
to use those variables so he's got this

0:31:19.760,0:31:24.880
go to xy

0:31:21.919,0:31:25.760
um and then he's also got this switch

0:31:24.880,0:31:29.279
costume

0:31:25.760,0:31:30.480
2 command so these are the things he's

0:31:29.279,0:31:32.000
going to do oh and then he's going to

0:31:30.480,0:31:34.559
also

0:31:32.000,0:31:35.760
show up after that right so remember

0:31:34.559,0:31:37.440
that with clones

0:31:35.760,0:31:38.960
and i can do this now here's the

0:31:37.440,0:31:39.679
original i'm actually going to hide the

0:31:38.960,0:31:42.240
original

0:31:39.679,0:31:44.240
which is very common to do with clones

0:31:42.240,0:31:45.679
i'm going to go to where i need to go

0:31:44.240,0:31:47.600
i'm going to set my costume and then i'm

0:31:45.679,0:31:48.799
going to show these values are not

0:31:47.600,0:31:49.679
correct though i need to use these

0:31:48.799,0:31:52.799
variables

0:31:49.679,0:31:55.519
so i need to use the placement x i need

0:31:52.799,0:31:57.440
to use the placement y

0:31:55.519,0:31:59.200
and then the fun thing about costumes is

0:31:57.440,0:32:00.720
you can refer to them by name

0:31:59.200,0:32:03.440
so you can see i've got got names for

0:32:00.720,0:32:06.159
all mine here or you can refer to it by

0:32:03.440,0:32:07.760
number and that's the the number that

0:32:06.159,0:32:08.559
you see in this upper left hand corner

0:32:07.760,0:32:10.080
here

0:32:08.559,0:32:11.919
so it's interesting that the names

0:32:10.080,0:32:13.120
actually didn't matter at all so if you

0:32:11.919,0:32:14.640
went through and you changed them all

0:32:13.120,0:32:16.880
then great but if not

0:32:14.640,0:32:17.840
we're not using the names at all so if i

0:32:16.880,0:32:20.960
run this

0:32:17.840,0:32:22.799
my tile should now show up in the corner

0:32:20.960,0:32:24.799
which is cool

0:32:22.799,0:32:26.960
these variables are all in the way so

0:32:24.799,0:32:28.000
i'm going to hit the green check boxes

0:32:26.960,0:32:30.640
on these

0:32:28.000,0:32:31.200
to hide these variables also this is

0:32:30.640,0:32:32.960
optional

0:32:31.200,0:32:34.799
there's the built-in variable called my

0:32:32.960,0:32:36.799
variable if you want to you can right

0:32:34.799,0:32:39.760
click on this and you can delete

0:32:36.799,0:32:40.159
the my variable variable we're going to

0:32:39.760,0:32:41.679
have

0:32:40.159,0:32:43.760
enough variables that we don't need the

0:32:41.679,0:32:45.600
extra clutter today

0:32:43.760,0:32:46.960
all right now from here uh you can kind

0:32:45.600,0:32:48.720
of see that what you could do

0:32:46.960,0:32:50.880
is you could right click on this and

0:32:48.720,0:32:53.919
duplicate it

0:32:50.880,0:32:55.760
and you could um you know just change it

0:32:53.919,0:32:57.039
to the next one over so the placement x

0:32:55.760,0:32:59.679
on this next one over

0:32:57.039,0:33:01.120
is going to be a zero and then the

0:32:59.679,0:33:04.640
costume is gonna be two

0:33:01.120,0:33:06.880
right so if you uh ran this

0:33:04.640,0:33:07.679
uh it should be pretty easy to put one

0:33:06.880,0:33:09.279
and two together

0:33:07.679,0:33:12.399
it kind of looks like minor disjoint but

0:33:09.279,0:33:15.519
but it actually worked and you could

0:33:12.399,0:33:17.600
repeat that nine times um and it and it

0:33:15.519,0:33:18.799
would work to place all the grids

0:33:17.600,0:33:20.880
campers do you think that's what we're

0:33:18.799,0:33:22.799
gonna do no no

0:33:20.880,0:33:23.840
what are we gonna do what are you gonna

0:33:22.799,0:33:24.960
what are we gonna do instead we're

0:33:23.840,0:33:26.399
computer scientists what do you guys

0:33:24.960,0:33:29.919
think we're gonna do

0:33:26.399,0:33:32.880
um if else repeats yeah

0:33:29.919,0:33:34.320
loops and and fun things like that um

0:33:32.880,0:33:35.600
and not only are we gonna use

0:33:34.320,0:33:37.200
loops and things like that but we're

0:33:35.600,0:33:38.480
gonna use functions as well because i

0:33:37.200,0:33:41.840
like functions

0:33:38.480,0:33:44.080
so let's start off by going to my blocks

0:33:41.840,0:33:46.000
and click on make a block i just like to

0:33:44.080,0:33:47.840
practice with functions

0:33:46.000,0:33:50.080
and so this function is going to be to

0:33:47.840,0:33:52.880
add a row

0:33:50.080,0:33:54.240
so add row is the name of our function

0:33:52.880,0:33:55.519
uh you can see that whenever you make a

0:33:54.240,0:33:56.320
function it kind of like gives you a

0:33:55.519,0:33:58.240
spot to

0:33:56.320,0:34:00.320
to put stuff into the insides of the

0:33:58.240,0:34:01.120
functions and the ability to call it

0:34:00.320,0:34:02.640
here

0:34:01.120,0:34:05.120
now i'm going to do a little bit of

0:34:02.640,0:34:06.640
refactoring first i'm going to take off

0:34:05.120,0:34:08.079
this bottom part that was just kind of

0:34:06.640,0:34:10.720
like the second tile that was just kind

0:34:08.079,0:34:12.079
of showed that you could do it

0:34:10.720,0:34:14.079
and then i'm going to kind of like pull

0:34:12.079,0:34:15.919
this one apart a little bit

0:34:14.079,0:34:17.200
so some things are going to go into add

0:34:15.919,0:34:17.919
row and some things are going to stay

0:34:17.200,0:34:21.599
here

0:34:17.919,0:34:23.040
so placement x that goes into add row

0:34:21.599,0:34:25.040
because that's going to be like the x

0:34:23.040,0:34:27.839
things that's for a single row

0:34:25.040,0:34:30.560
uh placement y that goes into when the

0:34:27.839,0:34:33.200
green flag is clicked

0:34:30.560,0:34:35.520
costume number setting it to 1 that goes

0:34:33.200,0:34:36.800
into the green flag clicked

0:34:35.520,0:34:39.200
and then this stuff is going to go

0:34:36.800,0:34:42.000
inside of a loop over here

0:34:39.200,0:34:43.440
so i kind of took my code and i broke it

0:34:42.000,0:34:45.280
down some

0:34:43.440,0:34:47.280
i happen to know that the x stuff

0:34:45.280,0:34:48.720
happens like inside of a row so it's

0:34:47.280,0:34:50.159
inside of the row area

0:34:48.720,0:34:52.079
whereas all these other things are

0:34:50.159,0:34:53.440
outside of it so here's what we're going

0:34:52.079,0:34:56.720
to do we're going to call

0:34:53.440,0:34:58.400
add row and we're going to make it work

0:34:56.720,0:35:00.000
how many tiles are there any true

0:34:58.400,0:35:01.680
campers three

0:35:00.000,0:35:04.480
three so we're going to make a loop that

0:35:01.680,0:35:07.200
repeats how many times

0:35:04.480,0:35:07.760
three times you got it so inside of that

0:35:07.200,0:35:11.119
loop

0:35:07.760,0:35:13.200
uh we're going to create a clone of the

0:35:11.119,0:35:14.480
tile

0:35:13.200,0:35:16.320
and you'll notice that for the first

0:35:14.480,0:35:17.760
tile the placement x and the placement y

0:35:16.320,0:35:19.839
are correct

0:35:17.760,0:35:21.040
if we just did this loop right now so if

0:35:19.839,0:35:22.800
i ran it right now it's going to be a

0:35:21.040,0:35:24.720
disaster because it's just going to put

0:35:22.800,0:35:27.040
number one number one and number one all

0:35:24.720,0:35:28.560
in the same spot right

0:35:27.040,0:35:30.320
so what i'm going to need to do is after

0:35:28.560,0:35:31.839
i place number one

0:35:30.320,0:35:34.560
i'm gonna have to change some of the

0:35:31.839,0:35:37.200
variables so let's go into variables

0:35:34.560,0:35:38.800
and we're gonna have to change the

0:35:37.200,0:35:42.000
costume number

0:35:38.800,0:35:45.440
and we're gonna have to change the

0:35:42.000,0:35:47.280
placement x

0:35:45.440,0:35:49.040
so we're going to change the costume

0:35:47.280,0:35:51.520
number by one because it's going to go

0:35:49.040,0:35:53.119
one two three four five you get the idea

0:35:51.520,0:35:55.359
and we're going to change the placement

0:35:53.119,0:35:57.440
x all right campers how much we're going

0:35:55.359,0:36:00.720
to change the placement x by

0:35:57.440,0:36:03.359
so from here to get over to the next one

0:36:00.720,0:36:04.320
120 120 i was waiting to see if you're

0:36:03.359,0:36:05.359
going to get it right or if you were

0:36:04.320,0:36:07.440
going to say 60.

0:36:05.359,0:36:09.119
yeah so we're going to place this one

0:36:07.440,0:36:10.240
we're going to move over 120 and we're

0:36:09.119,0:36:11.920
going to place this one

0:36:10.240,0:36:14.960
going to move over 120 and place this

0:36:11.920,0:36:16.560
one so that's going to be the whole row

0:36:14.960,0:36:20.480
so if i go ahead and run this i can see

0:36:16.560,0:36:22.560
that that whole row just like popped up

0:36:20.480,0:36:23.920
all right so mine came up great uh

0:36:22.560,0:36:26.000
keegan's actually came up

0:36:23.920,0:36:28.079
crazy um it's interesting you know i

0:36:26.000,0:36:30.160
said that names of the um

0:36:28.079,0:36:32.160
the names of the tiles didn't matter it

0:36:30.160,0:36:33.599
turns out that if they're numbers

0:36:32.160,0:36:35.520
that are numbered different that does

0:36:33.599,0:36:38.240
matter so make sure that if you do have

0:36:35.520,0:36:40.079
a name for each uh each costume

0:36:38.240,0:36:41.920
make sure it's either the matching

0:36:40.079,0:36:42.800
number uh or it's something different

0:36:41.920,0:36:44.880
like tile so

0:36:42.800,0:36:47.040
thank you for that keegan all right so

0:36:44.880,0:36:49.359
now uh we got one row done

0:36:47.040,0:36:50.160
uh now we're going to do many rows now

0:36:49.359,0:36:52.720
we could

0:36:50.160,0:36:53.520
uh as you know kind of like manually do

0:36:52.720,0:36:55.839
them

0:36:53.520,0:36:57.680
is that what we're gonna do no way how

0:36:55.839,0:36:59.680
many rows are there

0:36:57.680,0:37:01.520
three so we're gonna need a repeat three

0:36:59.680,0:37:03.440
so go and drag over a repeat three

0:37:01.520,0:37:06.560
command

0:37:03.440,0:37:08.640
so repeat three oops i'm

0:37:06.560,0:37:10.000
inside the repeat three uh we're going

0:37:08.640,0:37:12.640
to add row

0:37:10.000,0:37:14.400
which is going to be great if we were to

0:37:12.640,0:37:16.640
run this right now would add

0:37:14.400,0:37:18.560
one two three and then it would right on

0:37:16.640,0:37:20.079
top of it put in a four five six and

0:37:18.560,0:37:20.880
then right on top of that put a seven

0:37:20.079,0:37:23.440
eight nine

0:37:20.880,0:37:25.440
so obviously after we add a row we're

0:37:23.440,0:37:26.400
going to change the placement y so it

0:37:25.440,0:37:31.040
comes down

0:37:26.400,0:37:34.000
so let's go into variables change

0:37:31.040,0:37:34.000
the placement y

0:37:34.160,0:37:37.839
what's the value for placement y gonna

0:37:36.560,0:37:41.680
need to get changed by

0:37:37.839,0:37:43.680
120. oh not 120 that would go up

0:37:41.680,0:37:45.599
negative 120 there we go so negative

0:37:43.680,0:37:47.680
120.

0:37:45.599,0:37:50.000
uh and so now if this works uh it's

0:37:47.680,0:37:52.240
going to make your your whole grid

0:37:50.000,0:37:54.000
which i think is pretty cool right so

0:37:52.240,0:37:55.440
it's actually like taking your picture

0:37:54.000,0:37:58.560
and recombined it

0:37:55.440,0:38:00.000
now it's funny that in this game

0:37:58.560,0:38:02.640
it's like we started with a complete

0:38:00.000,0:38:04.560
picture then we chopped it up

0:38:02.640,0:38:05.920
and we made it all separate tiles and

0:38:04.560,0:38:07.280
then the first thing we did in the code

0:38:05.920,0:38:08.960
is we put it back together

0:38:07.280,0:38:10.400
um and then the next thing we're going

0:38:08.960,0:38:11.040
to do is now we're going to scramble it

0:38:10.400,0:38:14.400
all up

0:38:11.040,0:38:16.240
so um we don't actually want it to be an

0:38:14.400,0:38:18.240
order we actually want it to be

0:38:16.240,0:38:21.520
scrambled up

0:38:18.240,0:38:23.280
we also don't need tile number nine

0:38:21.520,0:38:24.960
and so we're gonna go in and make some

0:38:23.280,0:38:26.160
of those things happen so the first

0:38:24.960,0:38:27.599
thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make

0:38:26.160,0:38:30.160
tile number nine

0:38:27.599,0:38:32.960
not show up so to do that i'm gonna go

0:38:30.160,0:38:34.320
into and make an if statement

0:38:32.960,0:38:36.320
i'm actually going to use this one right

0:38:34.320,0:38:39.440
here so this if condition

0:38:36.320,0:38:41.440
then and i'm going to have two cases and

0:38:39.440,0:38:44.720
my condition is going to be

0:38:41.440,0:38:46.320
is the costume number number nine so i'm

0:38:44.720,0:38:49.440
going to find in operators i'm going to

0:38:46.320,0:38:53.680
find the equality one

0:38:49.440,0:38:56.880
and i'm curious if the costume number

0:38:53.680,0:39:00.000
is number nine so

0:38:56.880,0:39:00.800
normally i place it and then i wait for

0:39:00.000,0:39:02.320
a little bit

0:39:00.800,0:39:03.920
but costume number nine is gonna be

0:39:02.320,0:39:06.880
different so i'm gonna

0:39:03.920,0:39:07.760
i'm gonna re-um redo my loop here a

0:39:06.880,0:39:11.599
little bit

0:39:07.760,0:39:13.760
i'm gonna say uh these two always happen

0:39:11.599,0:39:15.200
so they're kind of like below my fl

0:39:13.760,0:39:15.839
statement so they are always going to

0:39:15.200,0:39:17.520
happen

0:39:15.839,0:39:19.599
but this creating a clone is going to

0:39:17.520,0:39:20.240
only happen if it's not costume number

0:39:19.599,0:39:21.920
nine

0:39:20.240,0:39:24.640
if i put it in the top that'd be when it

0:39:21.920,0:39:27.200
is costume 9 so i want to create a clone

0:39:24.640,0:39:28.000
down here when it's not costume 9. and

0:39:27.200,0:39:29.359
then now that i've got

0:39:28.000,0:39:32.079
this whole thing set up i'm going to put

0:39:29.359,0:39:34.240
it back and tied the repeat loop

0:39:32.079,0:39:35.760
refactoring code is always just a little

0:39:34.240,0:39:37.359
bit confusing because you have something

0:39:35.760,0:39:38.960
that looks like this

0:39:37.359,0:39:40.800
and if you were able to track what i was

0:39:38.960,0:39:41.760
doing exactly you were able to do at the

0:39:40.800,0:39:43.119
same time as me

0:39:41.760,0:39:44.160
but more important is that you can look

0:39:43.119,0:39:45.920
at it now and you can see that it's

0:39:44.160,0:39:47.440
correct so i've got a repeat three

0:39:45.920,0:39:49.440
i've got an if i don't have anything up

0:39:47.440,0:39:51.520
here right now and then i only create

0:39:49.440,0:39:53.280
the clone there but i always change it

0:39:51.520,0:39:55.040
if you run it again it should

0:39:53.280,0:39:58.320
successfully just leave off

0:39:55.040,0:39:59.119
tile number nine which is good now tile

0:39:58.320,0:40:01.839
number nine

0:39:59.119,0:40:02.400
is actually important to us um it's our

0:40:01.839,0:40:04.640
blank

0:40:02.400,0:40:06.880
right so we need to keep track of where

0:40:04.640,0:40:08.400
our blank is at at all times

0:40:06.880,0:40:09.920
because whenever somebody clicks on a

0:40:08.400,0:40:10.640
tile they're going to swap with the

0:40:09.920,0:40:11.680
blank

0:40:10.640,0:40:13.760
so we're going to make a couple

0:40:11.680,0:40:14.560
variables we're going to make a variable

0:40:13.760,0:40:18.480
called blank

0:40:14.560,0:40:21.200
x and then another variable called

0:40:18.480,0:40:21.200
blank y

0:40:21.760,0:40:24.319
i don't need them to show up on the

0:40:23.040,0:40:27.119
screen so i'm going to click on this

0:40:24.319,0:40:28.720
little blue checkbox and hide them

0:40:27.119,0:40:30.400
strangely i found that if you show them

0:40:28.720,0:40:31.599
there can be a bug so definitely make

0:40:30.400,0:40:33.119
sure you hide those

0:40:31.599,0:40:34.880
and what i'm going to do is in this gap

0:40:33.119,0:40:38.079
right here i'm going to set

0:40:34.880,0:40:41.680
blank x and blank y so blank

0:40:38.079,0:40:43.359
x and then blank y

0:40:41.680,0:40:45.359
and they're going to get set to whatever

0:40:43.359,0:40:48.720
the placement x

0:40:45.359,0:40:49.200
and placement y are so wherever this

0:40:48.720,0:40:51.760
tile

0:40:49.200,0:40:53.920
should have gone in at we're gonna save

0:40:51.760,0:40:55.920
that off as blank x and blank y

0:40:53.920,0:40:59.040
and then we can use that knowledge uh

0:40:55.920,0:41:00.800
later in our code which is gonna be cool

0:40:59.040,0:41:03.680
all right now comes some fun stuff so

0:41:00.800,0:41:05.440
now like you're on day four of this camp

0:41:03.680,0:41:06.720
uh the gloves kind of come off against

0:41:05.440,0:41:08.319
coding we're going to do we're going to

0:41:06.720,0:41:10.400
start doing some crazier things

0:41:08.319,0:41:12.640
so what i want to do is i want to

0:41:10.400,0:41:15.440
shuffle these tiles all around

0:41:12.640,0:41:16.720
so here's my my plan i'm going to

0:41:15.440,0:41:18.960
randomly select

0:41:16.720,0:41:20.640
a number and then i'm going to move it

0:41:18.960,0:41:21.520
into the blank if it's a valid thing to

0:41:20.640,0:41:23.280
move

0:41:21.520,0:41:24.480
and i'm going to do that to shuffle it

0:41:23.280,0:41:25.760
up how many times do you guys think we

0:41:24.480,0:41:26.880
ought to do that just to kind of shuffle

0:41:25.760,0:41:29.040
it up

0:41:26.880,0:41:30.480
any guesses a million times so the first

0:41:29.040,0:41:32.720
guess was a million times

0:41:30.480,0:41:34.319
so you can go into control uh and you

0:41:32.720,0:41:36.640
can bring over repeat loop

0:41:34.319,0:41:37.760
the first guess was a million times uh

0:41:36.640,0:41:40.480
that would actually

0:41:37.760,0:41:42.240
take uh very long right um so here's

0:41:40.480,0:41:44.160
what we're gonna do

0:41:42.240,0:41:45.359
bob and i have played with this and we

0:41:44.160,0:41:48.880
think that 300

0:41:45.359,0:41:50.480
is the perfect number for testing though

0:41:48.880,0:41:52.560
i'm going to only use 100 so i'm going

0:41:50.480,0:41:54.240
to do 100 shuffles

0:41:52.560,0:41:56.319
and that way it's faster when i'm

0:41:54.240,0:41:58.720
testing but before i ship my game i'm

0:41:56.319,0:42:00.880
going to change this to 300 sound good

0:41:58.720,0:42:02.240
so this will make testing faster and

0:42:00.880,0:42:03.440
then the thing that i'm going to do a

0:42:02.240,0:42:06.640
hundred times

0:42:03.440,0:42:11.280
is i'm going to randomly pick

0:42:06.640,0:42:14.079
a costume number so i'm going to say set

0:42:11.280,0:42:15.440
costume number and i'm going to set it

0:42:14.079,0:42:18.640
to a random number

0:42:15.440,0:42:21.200
so i'm going to go into operators pick

0:42:18.640,0:42:21.200
random

0:42:21.680,0:42:28.400
and the random number that i pick

0:42:24.880,0:42:30.000
could be one through eight so there's no

0:42:28.400,0:42:32.000
reason to do number nine because there

0:42:30.000,0:42:32.480
is no number nine so i'm gonna randomly

0:42:32.000,0:42:34.400
pick

0:42:32.480,0:42:36.000
one through eight and then i'm gonna

0:42:34.400,0:42:38.319
broadcast an event

0:42:36.000,0:42:40.720
so i'm gonna go into events uh and i'm

0:42:38.319,0:42:42.400
gonna say broadcast

0:42:40.720,0:42:43.760
and the message i'm gonna broadcast i'm

0:42:42.400,0:42:47.760
gonna make a new message

0:42:43.760,0:42:48.319
called shuffle so at this point in the

0:42:47.760,0:42:50.720
code

0:42:48.319,0:42:52.400
there's eight clones out there they're

0:42:50.720,0:42:54.240
all gonna listen for shuffle

0:42:52.400,0:42:55.839
right and i'm gonna broadcast it a

0:42:54.240,0:42:56.240
hundred times in a row real fast i'm

0:42:55.839,0:42:59.200
gonna say

0:42:56.240,0:42:59.680
shuffle shuffle shuffle you get the idea

0:42:59.200,0:43:02.000
and then

0:42:59.680,0:43:03.200
each tile is going to have a job they're

0:43:02.000,0:43:06.240
going to say

0:43:03.200,0:43:07.359
um was it me that was total shuffle um

0:43:06.240,0:43:08.640
and then they're going to check to see

0:43:07.359,0:43:09.680
if they're with if they're touching the

0:43:08.640,0:43:11.200
blank or not

0:43:09.680,0:43:12.800
and if they are they're going to swap

0:43:11.200,0:43:14.800
does that sound sound good

0:43:12.800,0:43:17.119
so let's go uh from here so we're

0:43:14.800,0:43:19.119
broadcasting shuffle 100 times

0:43:17.119,0:43:20.160
we're picking a random tile to actually

0:43:19.119,0:43:23.359
listen to it

0:43:20.160,0:43:24.880
so let's go into our tile code

0:43:23.359,0:43:26.880
so in our tile code what we're going to

0:43:24.880,0:43:30.000
do is we're going to say when i receive

0:43:26.880,0:43:31.920
shuffle so there's

0:43:30.000,0:43:33.280
eight clones of this right and they all

0:43:31.920,0:43:34.720
have different costume numbers

0:43:33.280,0:43:36.560
the first thing we want to know is is

0:43:34.720,0:43:38.400
this message for me so we're going to

0:43:36.560,0:43:39.839
have an if statement

0:43:38.400,0:43:41.440
and we're going to decide is this

0:43:39.839,0:43:43.359
message for me

0:43:41.440,0:43:45.200
um and we're going to check that with

0:43:43.359,0:43:48.640
the equals operator

0:43:45.200,0:43:50.720
so he called out a number so he called

0:43:48.640,0:43:53.440
out a costume number

0:43:50.720,0:43:54.160
and the question is is that costume

0:43:53.440,0:43:56.880
number

0:43:54.160,0:43:58.319
my costume number so if it was my

0:43:56.880,0:43:58.960
costume number then i need to do

0:43:58.319,0:44:01.200
something

0:43:58.960,0:44:03.280
how do i know if it's my costume number

0:44:01.200,0:44:06.000
well over in looks

0:44:03.280,0:44:07.040
each clone has this variable called

0:44:06.000,0:44:09.839
costume number

0:44:07.040,0:44:10.800
that's perfect so if the number he

0:44:09.839,0:44:12.480
called

0:44:10.800,0:44:14.480
so if the number he called his costume

0:44:12.480,0:44:17.280
number um if it was me

0:44:14.480,0:44:18.480
then i need to do something the thing

0:44:17.280,0:44:20.000
i'm going to do i'm going to put in a

0:44:18.480,0:44:22.640
function because i like functions

0:44:20.000,0:44:24.079
so let's go ahead and make a function

0:44:22.640,0:44:27.760
and we'll call this function

0:44:24.079,0:44:30.880
try to move so

0:44:27.760,0:44:32.480
if we're next to the blank we will move

0:44:30.880,0:44:33.760
if we're not next to the blank then we

0:44:32.480,0:44:36.319
won't move so i'm going to make a

0:44:33.760,0:44:39.520
function called try to move

0:44:36.319,0:44:42.160
so i'm going to call it right here so if

0:44:39.520,0:44:44.079
it's my number that he called then try

0:44:42.160,0:44:46.400
to move

0:44:44.079,0:44:47.839
all right now it's right try to move so

0:44:46.400,0:44:49.359
the first thing try to move has to

0:44:47.839,0:44:50.000
figure out is they have to figure out if

0:44:49.359,0:44:51.920
they're next to

0:44:50.000,0:44:53.760
the blank so let's look at my board here

0:44:51.920,0:44:55.760
so my board doesn't have a tile nine

0:44:53.760,0:44:57.760
anymore

0:44:55.760,0:45:01.440
um it's instead got this blank and this

0:44:57.760,0:45:02.880
blank has a value that's right here

0:45:01.440,0:45:05.680
so based on the board that i'm looking

0:45:02.880,0:45:07.680
at here campers which tiles can move

0:45:05.680,0:45:09.599
so which ones can move into this blank

0:45:07.680,0:45:11.119
six six and eight that's right so

0:45:09.599,0:45:13.200
they're the only ones that can do it

0:45:11.119,0:45:14.480
so the question is how how are they

0:45:13.200,0:45:16.720
special um

0:45:14.480,0:45:17.520
and they're special in my opinion

0:45:16.720,0:45:21.440
because their

0:45:17.520,0:45:22.880
centers are close to this center

0:45:21.440,0:45:25.680
and the distance that they are away from

0:45:22.880,0:45:27.200
the center is they're 120 away from the

0:45:25.680,0:45:28.720
center

0:45:27.200,0:45:30.319
and so what we're going to say is we're

0:45:28.720,0:45:32.720
going to we're going to look at

0:45:30.319,0:45:34.800
rx compared to his x we're going to look

0:45:32.720,0:45:37.920
at our y compared to his y

0:45:34.800,0:45:40.720
and if the grand total is less than uh

0:45:37.920,0:45:43.359
maybe like 121 or 130

0:45:40.720,0:45:44.880
then we know that we can move mckinley

0:45:43.359,0:45:47.280
do you have a question

0:45:44.880,0:45:48.880
what if they're all hers what if they're

0:45:47.280,0:45:51.119
all hers i keep saying him so

0:45:48.880,0:45:53.040
yeah i should work on my my pronouns

0:45:51.119,0:45:54.880
thank you for keeping me honest there

0:45:53.040,0:45:57.040
now there's also ones that are like way

0:45:54.880,0:46:01.520
up here um and this one is

0:45:57.040,0:46:03.119
is too far right so um here's our plan

0:46:01.520,0:46:05.920
we're going to figure out how far we are

0:46:03.119,0:46:08.960
away so we're going to do a comparison

0:46:05.920,0:46:13.359
between the blanks

0:46:08.960,0:46:18.240
x and y versus

0:46:13.359,0:46:18.240
my current x position and y position

0:46:19.359,0:46:23.119
so these are the the variables that are

0:46:21.680,0:46:24.640
going to be involved in this

0:46:23.119,0:46:27.040
um and what we want to do is we want to

0:46:24.640,0:46:28.880
know the the delta between the x's and

0:46:27.040,0:46:32.240
the delta between the y's

0:46:28.880,0:46:34.480
so to get a delta that's uh subtraction

0:46:32.240,0:46:35.760
so i'm going to grab a subtraction

0:46:34.480,0:46:37.119
symbol here

0:46:35.760,0:46:38.960
and a subtraction symbol here so i'm

0:46:37.119,0:46:42.480
going to say blank x

0:46:38.960,0:46:45.599
minus x position blank y

0:46:42.480,0:46:46.640
minus y position so this is going to

0:46:45.599,0:46:50.400
give me the

0:46:46.640,0:46:52.400
the delta x or the delta y

0:46:50.400,0:46:54.079
now it might be a positive number might

0:46:52.400,0:46:55.359
be a negative number and i don't i don't

0:46:54.079,0:46:56.560
care if it's positive or negative i

0:46:55.359,0:46:58.160
always want a positive

0:46:56.560,0:47:00.560
do you guys know what function will will

0:46:58.160,0:47:03.599
make something always be a positive

0:47:00.560,0:47:05.839
all right i think keegan's got it

0:47:03.599,0:47:07.359
absolute value that's right i took a

0:47:05.839,0:47:08.480
little coaxing here but it's called an

0:47:07.359,0:47:10.160
absolute value

0:47:08.480,0:47:12.079
so scratch has this thing it's like can

0:47:10.160,0:47:13.920
do all kinds of crazy math things but

0:47:12.079,0:47:15.839
the one we want is abs

0:47:13.920,0:47:17.599
because it stands for absolute value you

0:47:15.839,0:47:18.480
may have never seen absolute value in

0:47:17.599,0:47:20.559
school yet

0:47:18.480,0:47:23.520
but believe me you will right so i want

0:47:20.559,0:47:26.720
the absolute value of the delta x

0:47:23.520,0:47:28.079
and the absolute value of the delta y

0:47:26.720,0:47:29.280
now what i'm going to choose to do is

0:47:28.079,0:47:30.160
i'm going to choose to add these two

0:47:29.280,0:47:33.520
together

0:47:30.160,0:47:35.119
so to add them i need the plus operator

0:47:33.520,0:47:36.240
make sure that you get the plus operator

0:47:35.119,0:47:37.920
when i prep this i grab the

0:47:36.240,0:47:38.960
multiplication operator trust me that

0:47:37.920,0:47:41.040
did not work right

0:47:38.960,0:47:42.160
so i need the plus operator and i'm just

0:47:41.040,0:47:43.839
going to add

0:47:42.160,0:47:45.599
these two together by the way whenever

0:47:43.839,0:47:47.040
your your operators kind of get complex

0:47:45.599,0:47:47.680
make sure you always grab it from the

0:47:47.040,0:47:50.079
middle

0:47:47.680,0:47:53.280
so this one the middle is the of so i'm

0:47:50.079,0:47:54.640
going to drop this into one half

0:47:53.280,0:47:56.400
and then i'm going to grab the of here

0:47:54.640,0:47:58.000
and drop this into the other half

0:47:56.400,0:47:59.440
and now for this big one if i want to

0:47:58.000,0:48:00.400
move it i have to make sure i grab the

0:47:59.440,0:48:02.880
plus right so

0:48:00.400,0:48:05.040
so we're not done yet what we want to do

0:48:02.880,0:48:07.520
is we want to see if this whole thing

0:48:05.040,0:48:10.000
is less than i'm going to use a

0:48:07.520,0:48:12.800
threshold of 130 right

0:48:10.000,0:48:14.800
and the 130 will make sure to pick off

0:48:12.800,0:48:15.760
everybody including the diagonal

0:48:14.800,0:48:17.440
but that'll give you a little

0:48:15.760,0:48:18.800
flexibility in case your images are a

0:48:17.440,0:48:23.280
little too big right

0:48:18.800,0:48:26.319
so i'm going to say if

0:48:23.280,0:48:28.400
this whole thing is less than 130 so i'm

0:48:26.319,0:48:32.240
going to go ahead and grab a less than

0:48:28.400,0:48:34.400
and 130. so if this whole thing so i've

0:48:32.240,0:48:37.680
got to grab it from the plus here

0:48:34.400,0:48:39.040
and drop it into there it's so big it

0:48:37.680,0:48:39.599
doesn't even fit on the screen anymore

0:48:39.040,0:48:42.160
right

0:48:39.599,0:48:42.880
so if that whole thing is less than 130

0:48:42.160,0:48:46.160
then

0:48:42.880,0:48:47.839
i must be next to the blank and this

0:48:46.160,0:48:49.440
algorithm will work even if the blanks

0:48:47.839,0:48:51.200
in the middle then it'll figure out that

0:48:49.440,0:48:53.680
these four can move right so it's kind

0:48:51.200,0:48:57.520
of a smart algorithm

0:48:53.680,0:48:59.599
so now what happens if if we are a match

0:48:57.520,0:49:03.040
if we're a match we've got a swap with

0:48:59.599,0:49:05.200
the blank um swapping

0:49:03.040,0:49:07.200
is a very popular thing that happens in

0:49:05.200,0:49:09.119
computer science

0:49:07.200,0:49:10.400
so uh let's see here so let's say i had

0:49:09.119,0:49:13.599
two variables i had a

0:49:10.400,0:49:16.079
is five and b is seven

0:49:13.599,0:49:17.760
if i wanted to swap them i could say

0:49:16.079,0:49:20.800
that a is equal to b

0:49:17.760,0:49:20.800
and b is equal to a

0:49:21.119,0:49:25.119
campers would this work in code

0:49:25.760,0:49:29.280
so this is an interesting problem that

0:49:27.680,0:49:30.800
happens in code let's let's step through

0:49:29.280,0:49:33.359
what happens just because i like it

0:49:30.800,0:49:34.800
so this is the values of a and b like as

0:49:33.359,0:49:37.839
this code executes

0:49:34.800,0:49:38.079
so right here a is five after this line

0:49:37.839,0:49:39.760
a

0:49:38.079,0:49:41.119
is still five of course but now b is

0:49:39.760,0:49:43.280
seven

0:49:41.119,0:49:45.119
after this line of code runs it says b

0:49:43.280,0:49:48.559
is equal to a so it actually

0:49:45.119,0:49:50.640
reassigns a so a is now seven

0:49:48.559,0:49:51.839
but b is still seven and then this line

0:49:50.640,0:49:55.520
does nothing

0:49:51.839,0:49:58.640
so um this direct

0:49:55.520,0:50:00.880
change a is b and b is a doesn't work

0:49:58.640,0:50:02.480
which is interesting because of how

0:50:00.880,0:50:05.119
sequential programming works

0:50:02.480,0:50:06.960
and the trick to fix this problem is you

0:50:05.119,0:50:10.079
need a temporary variable

0:50:06.960,0:50:12.319
so i'm going to call it t so i'm going

0:50:10.079,0:50:14.880
to save off the value of a

0:50:12.319,0:50:16.079
into this variable t that's a temporary

0:50:14.880,0:50:18.480
variable

0:50:16.079,0:50:20.960
now i can blow away a and then at the

0:50:18.480,0:50:23.440
bottom here i just have to use t

0:50:20.960,0:50:24.640
and this trick does work if i were to

0:50:23.440,0:50:28.559
put t over here

0:50:24.640,0:50:32.240
we'd have like five seven and five

0:50:28.559,0:50:33.839
and then we blow away a and then we set

0:50:32.240,0:50:35.359
b to that temporary variable

0:50:33.839,0:50:36.800
and then interestingly at the end of the

0:50:35.359,0:50:38.000
day we don't care about that temporary

0:50:36.800,0:50:41.520
variable

0:50:38.000,0:50:42.240
so it's a very common thing in computer

0:50:41.520,0:50:44.880
science

0:50:42.240,0:50:45.280
where you want to swap two things and

0:50:44.880,0:50:47.200
you

0:50:45.280,0:50:49.119
you can't just swap them like you would

0:50:47.200,0:50:50.559
think you have to make a temporary

0:50:49.119,0:50:52.640
variable

0:50:50.559,0:50:54.079
all right let's just do it right so we

0:50:52.640,0:50:56.160
want to swap

0:50:54.079,0:50:57.599
my position with the blanks position so

0:50:56.160,0:50:58.720
that's our goal

0:50:57.599,0:51:00.559
and we're going to have to make a

0:50:58.720,0:51:00.960
temporary variable which we just learned

0:51:00.559,0:51:02.559
about

0:51:00.960,0:51:06.160
so let's go and make two variables we'll

0:51:02.559,0:51:08.000
call one temp x

0:51:06.160,0:51:09.920
and then the other one is going to be

0:51:08.000,0:51:11.760
temp y

0:51:09.920,0:51:13.520
so we need a temporary variable for the

0:51:11.760,0:51:14.800
x and temporary variable y

0:51:13.520,0:51:16.880
i don't want to show them so i'm going

0:51:14.800,0:51:20.559
to hide them

0:51:16.880,0:51:21.920
and now i'm going to do a bunch of steps

0:51:20.559,0:51:24.480
so the first thing i'm going to do is

0:51:21.920,0:51:29.200
i'm going to set my temporary variables

0:51:24.480,0:51:30.480
so i'm going to say temp x and temp y

0:51:29.200,0:51:32.319
and the thing that i'm going to choose

0:51:30.480,0:51:35.440
to save off is i'm going to choose to

0:51:32.319,0:51:39.359
save off the x position and y position

0:51:35.440,0:51:42.319
so i'm going to save off x position

0:51:39.359,0:51:42.319
and y position

0:51:43.200,0:51:47.520
so the nice thing is is that once i save

0:51:45.680,0:51:50.240
them off into a temporary variable

0:51:47.520,0:51:51.920
then i can blow them away right so i can

0:51:50.240,0:51:54.079
change them

0:51:51.920,0:51:55.040
the fastest way to change them is this

0:51:54.079,0:51:58.960
command that says

0:51:55.040,0:52:00.400
go to xy

0:51:58.960,0:52:02.000
interestingly you could also set them

0:52:00.400,0:52:03.599
individually with this like set x and

0:52:02.000,0:52:05.200
set y but we'll just kind of do it

0:52:03.599,0:52:06.720
all in one shot and the thing we're

0:52:05.200,0:52:08.079
going to set them to is we're going to

0:52:06.720,0:52:10.079
move this tile

0:52:08.079,0:52:11.839
to wherever the blank is at does that

0:52:10.079,0:52:15.040
make sense

0:52:11.839,0:52:16.880
so this tile is going to move and it's

0:52:15.040,0:52:18.400
going to move to wherever the blank was

0:52:16.880,0:52:20.000
at

0:52:18.400,0:52:22.240
and then the blank is going to be where

0:52:20.000,0:52:23.599
this tile was so they they swapped it's

0:52:22.240,0:52:26.800
called a swap right

0:52:23.599,0:52:26.800
so now i need to set

0:52:26.960,0:52:36.480
blank x and blank y

0:52:32.319,0:52:39.440
to those temporary variables temp x

0:52:36.480,0:52:40.720
and temp y i can't set them to x and y

0:52:39.440,0:52:42.640
anymore because those those have been

0:52:40.720,0:52:46.240
changed by this blue line right

0:52:42.640,0:52:49.359
but i can use those temporary variables

0:52:46.240,0:52:51.359
so it's kind of a fun crazy thing so

0:52:49.359,0:52:52.800
i'm going to pause it and ask my campers

0:52:51.359,0:52:54.880
if they understand this code

0:52:52.800,0:52:56.240
because it's kind of complex right so

0:52:54.880,0:52:59.440
make sure you can look at this

0:52:56.240,0:53:00.960
and explain what's going on

0:52:59.440,0:53:03.680
all right well i should see if this

0:53:00.960,0:53:05.200
works uh so when i click this green flag

0:53:03.680,0:53:07.040
what should happens it should shuffle

0:53:05.200,0:53:08.800
them a hundred times

0:53:07.040,0:53:10.720
and so it happens kind of quick uh and

0:53:08.800,0:53:12.559
it shuffles them around

0:53:10.720,0:53:14.720
you'll notice that they're not shuffled

0:53:12.559,0:53:16.079
great they're shuffled uh good enough

0:53:14.720,0:53:17.440
for testing

0:53:16.079,0:53:19.280
eventually we're going to change this

0:53:17.440,0:53:20.960
number to be 300

0:53:19.280,0:53:22.800
uh which i think will shuffle them a

0:53:20.960,0:53:24.480
little bit better so like you can see

0:53:22.800,0:53:25.599
before my number one was still in the

0:53:24.480,0:53:27.920
upper left

0:53:25.599,0:53:30.000
but with 300 it shuffles them a little

0:53:27.920,0:53:31.839
better i think that one shuffled enough

0:53:30.000,0:53:34.640
uh but but i'm going to actually leave

0:53:31.839,0:53:37.040
it at 100 for my testing

0:53:34.640,0:53:38.800
that way it's faster and then as soon as

0:53:37.040,0:53:39.520
i finish my game i'll put it back to

0:53:38.800,0:53:41.520
300.

0:53:39.520,0:53:43.200
does that sound good by the way it's

0:53:41.520,0:53:45.200
also good to take breaks every so often

0:53:43.200,0:53:47.760
so as soon as you see that this works

0:53:45.200,0:53:49.680
um maybe take a break right so just take

0:53:47.760,0:53:51.920
a take a break pause the video walk away

0:53:49.680,0:53:53.200
and come back a little bit later

0:53:51.920,0:53:54.960
all right are you back from your break

0:53:53.200,0:53:56.079
uh let's do some more stuff so the next

0:53:54.960,0:53:58.240
thing that i think really

0:53:56.079,0:53:59.839
needs to happen is i want to be able to

0:53:58.240,0:54:02.319
click on a tile

0:53:59.839,0:54:04.160
and have it glide into position right so

0:54:02.319,0:54:06.000
i want it to kind of glide over

0:54:04.160,0:54:07.520
so let's see if we can implement that

0:54:06.000,0:54:10.000
and to be honest that's actually one of

0:54:07.520,0:54:11.280
the last required things for today

0:54:10.000,0:54:13.520
my campers are going to have to do the

0:54:11.280,0:54:15.040
whole thing but after this step you

0:54:13.520,0:54:17.200
you could be done after today because it

0:54:15.040,0:54:18.640
is pretty big so let's make it to where

0:54:17.200,0:54:21.599
when you click on one of these

0:54:18.640,0:54:22.960
it'll glide into position really nicely

0:54:21.599,0:54:24.960
so here's what i want to do i want to go

0:54:22.960,0:54:26.400
into my tile code

0:54:24.960,0:54:28.319
and you can see that my tile code

0:54:26.400,0:54:31.440
already has like a when i receive

0:54:28.319,0:54:32.559
shuffle when i start as clone so it's

0:54:31.440,0:54:33.760
kind of got all these things

0:54:32.559,0:54:36.480
and we're going to make something else

0:54:33.760,0:54:39.599
we're going to get an event

0:54:36.480,0:54:41.200
called when the sprite is clicked so

0:54:39.599,0:54:42.799
when the sprite is clicked what do we

0:54:41.200,0:54:44.240
want to do

0:54:42.799,0:54:46.799
so what we're going to do is actually

0:54:44.240,0:54:49.760
similar in many ways to shuffle

0:54:46.799,0:54:50.960
because we're going to try to move

0:54:49.760,0:54:52.400
that's going to be our main thing

0:54:50.960,0:54:54.079
we don't have to check where the ones

0:54:52.400,0:54:56.319
click we know where the ones clicked

0:54:54.079,0:54:57.520
and so like when this tile is clicked we

0:54:56.319,0:54:59.200
want to try to move

0:54:57.520,0:55:02.000
let's go ahead and try it with just that

0:54:59.200,0:55:04.000
additional code so it does my shuffling

0:55:02.000,0:55:05.280
and so now oh i had this goof this

0:55:04.000,0:55:06.000
sometimes happens i've got a goof to

0:55:05.280,0:55:08.000
where i've got two

0:55:06.000,0:55:10.240
holes i'm going to pretend like i didn't

0:55:08.000,0:55:12.480
see that and just run it again so you

0:55:10.240,0:55:13.920
can do the same but that happens to you

0:55:12.480,0:55:16.079
so right now what should happen if i

0:55:13.920,0:55:17.359
click on seven it should try to move

0:55:16.079,0:55:20.079
one should try to move and it should

0:55:17.359,0:55:21.280
work but if i click on like four it

0:55:20.079,0:55:23.760
shouldn't do anything

0:55:21.280,0:55:24.559
right only the ones that are next to the

0:55:23.760,0:55:27.920
tile

0:55:24.559,0:55:28.880
uh can move so i think that that

0:55:27.920,0:55:31.440
actually uh

0:55:28.880,0:55:33.359
is doing pretty well it looks like i can

0:55:31.440,0:55:35.520
play the game if i wanted right now

0:55:33.359,0:55:37.599
i could use my algorithm to try to solve

0:55:35.520,0:55:39.359
it i'm not going to right now but i

0:55:37.599,0:55:41.920
could right so i could actually like try

0:55:39.359,0:55:43.599
to solve this thing

0:55:41.920,0:55:46.880
instead what i want to do is i want when

0:55:43.599,0:55:48.640
i click it i want it to smoothly glide

0:55:46.880,0:55:51.359
right so you can see that right now it's

0:55:48.640,0:55:53.119
just going there it's just snapping over

0:55:51.359,0:55:54.880
i think it would be cool to have kind of

0:55:53.119,0:55:57.920
like a slide animation

0:55:54.880,0:55:59.839
so how do we do that so uh the first

0:55:57.920,0:56:00.400
thing we need to do is this go block in

0:55:59.839,0:56:02.640
here

0:56:00.400,0:56:03.520
needs to have an if statement around it

0:56:02.640,0:56:05.200
so here's what i'm going to do i'm going

0:56:03.520,0:56:08.240
to go into control

0:56:05.200,0:56:10.160
and i'm going to grab an if else

0:56:08.240,0:56:12.079
so sometimes i want to get there like

0:56:10.160,0:56:13.040
immediately and then other times i want

0:56:12.079,0:56:15.680
to glide

0:56:13.040,0:56:17.440
so i'm going to go ahead and break this

0:56:15.680,0:56:20.960
up a little bit

0:56:17.440,0:56:24.319
and i want just this blue line in here

0:56:20.960,0:56:28.480
and then i want to put that on the top

0:56:24.319,0:56:30.799
sorry that on the bottom that on the top

0:56:28.480,0:56:32.559
so this refactoring thing again and this

0:56:30.799,0:56:35.200
is going to be in this area

0:56:32.559,0:56:36.960
i'm going to kind of put it all back in

0:56:35.200,0:56:38.559
so i'm still going to do the swap so

0:56:36.960,0:56:40.079
same thing as before

0:56:38.559,0:56:41.839
it's just instead of a go to i'm going

0:56:40.079,0:56:45.040
to use a different command

0:56:41.839,0:56:48.160
called glide 2

0:56:45.040,0:56:50.720
x y so sometimes i'm going to go there

0:56:48.160,0:56:51.839
and sometimes i'm going to glide there

0:56:50.720,0:56:53.520
now

0:56:51.839,0:56:55.200
operator or variables here i'm going to

0:56:53.520,0:56:59.920
move in

0:56:55.200,0:57:03.359
blank x and blank y

0:56:59.920,0:57:04.480
and this glide i'm going to glide in 0.2

0:57:03.359,0:57:07.839
seconds

0:57:04.480,0:57:09.040
so sometimes i want to go sometimes i

0:57:07.839,0:57:11.040
want to glide

0:57:09.040,0:57:12.720
how am i going to decide whether it

0:57:11.040,0:57:14.480
should be a go or a glide

0:57:12.720,0:57:15.920
so what i want to do is i want to pass

0:57:14.480,0:57:18.480
into this function

0:57:15.920,0:57:19.680
an argument this is something new so

0:57:18.480,0:57:21.440
right click

0:57:19.680,0:57:22.720
so your right mouse button right click

0:57:21.440,0:57:25.839
on this word define

0:57:22.720,0:57:27.359
and click on edit and what i want to do

0:57:25.839,0:57:28.000
is i don't just want to have a function

0:57:27.359,0:57:29.599
i want to

0:57:28.000,0:57:32.640
add an input i'm going to add this

0:57:29.599,0:57:34.240
number or text so i'm click right here

0:57:32.640,0:57:35.920
and i'm going to give this argument a

0:57:34.240,0:57:40.000
name i'm going to call it

0:57:35.920,0:57:41.280
go or glide and you can make it say like

0:57:40.000,0:57:43.599
uh go over glide like this but what

0:57:41.280,0:57:47.280
we're gonna do is go is gonna be a one

0:57:43.599,0:57:50.880
so i'm gonna say like go one or glide

0:57:47.280,0:57:52.640
two so i'm gonna call it go one

0:57:50.880,0:57:54.960
or glide two so they're gonna pass in a

0:57:52.640,0:57:58.400
one or a two one for go

0:57:54.960,0:58:00.880
two for glide and so now you can see

0:57:58.400,0:58:02.720
that it says up here uh try to move go

0:58:00.880,0:58:04.400
or glide right there

0:58:02.720,0:58:05.760
and then when i call it you can see that

0:58:04.400,0:58:08.400
it added this thing so this

0:58:05.760,0:58:09.440
when i'm shuffling it's a go so go is

0:58:08.400,0:58:11.200
one

0:58:09.440,0:58:12.480
and then when i click it it's a glide so

0:58:11.200,0:58:16.400
glide is two

0:58:12.480,0:58:19.520
so go one glide two

0:58:16.400,0:58:22.240
now i need to use that variable

0:58:19.520,0:58:23.760
in here so i'm gonna go to operators and

0:58:22.240,0:58:26.720
grab an equals

0:58:23.760,0:58:28.400
so where's my equals operator so if and

0:58:26.720,0:58:29.520
then this is tricky you actually grab it

0:58:28.400,0:58:31.119
from here

0:58:29.520,0:58:32.319
and put it down there which i think

0:58:31.119,0:58:34.079
that's kind of tricky how you just kind

0:58:32.319,0:58:37.760
of do it from right right inside here

0:58:34.079,0:58:39.359
so if go or glide is a one

0:58:37.760,0:58:41.280
then we want to go there that way

0:58:39.359,0:58:43.359
shuffling is fast right

0:58:41.280,0:58:44.960
um but if it's a click we want to glide

0:58:43.359,0:58:45.599
there so let's try it so right now i

0:58:44.960,0:58:48.960
shuffle

0:58:45.599,0:58:50.160
and it's fast um it did the two blank

0:58:48.960,0:58:50.720
thing i'm gonna pretend like i didn't

0:58:50.160,0:58:53.440
see that

0:58:50.720,0:58:54.559
moving on so now uh whenever i click it

0:58:53.440,0:58:56.400
uh things should

0:58:54.559,0:58:58.000
glide to the correct position which is

0:58:56.400,0:58:59.599
cool

0:58:58.000,0:59:02.240
uh and now what we're gonna do is we're

0:58:59.599,0:59:05.359
gonna give you the option

0:59:02.240,0:59:06.720
of adding the extra features or not so

0:59:05.359,0:59:08.000
you can see that right now the game is

0:59:06.720,0:59:10.160
completely playable

0:59:08.000,0:59:11.440
uh and you you can win it uh which is

0:59:10.160,0:59:13.920
cool

0:59:11.440,0:59:14.720
if you would like to be done right here

0:59:13.920,0:59:17.520
today

0:59:14.720,0:59:18.079
you could be pat yourself in the back go

0:59:17.520,0:59:21.200
do something

0:59:18.079,0:59:23.200
else call it done if you wanted to

0:59:21.200,0:59:24.079
though we've got some extra features for

0:59:23.200,0:59:27.280
you

0:59:24.079,0:59:27.920
so for example it feels unsatisfying uh

0:59:27.280,0:59:30.960
that you

0:59:27.920,0:59:33.599
win and nothing happens right and so

0:59:30.960,0:59:35.200
it'd be nice to add that feature

0:59:33.599,0:59:36.799
it also would be neat to add kind of

0:59:35.200,0:59:38.160
like a moves counter so you know how

0:59:36.799,0:59:39.920
long it took you to do it

0:59:38.160,0:59:41.760
um and so those added features is what

0:59:39.920,0:59:43.599
we're going to add next

0:59:41.760,0:59:45.599
and it is just a little bit complicated

0:59:43.599,0:59:47.920
so if you feel like calling it today

0:59:45.599,0:59:49.680
great job we'll see you tomorrow for the

0:59:47.920,0:59:51.359
final day of coding camp

0:59:49.680,0:59:53.119
if you've got the energy to do these

0:59:51.359,0:59:55.839
last things then

0:59:53.119,0:59:58.240
let's go ahead and do them together so

0:59:55.839,1:00:01.280
what i want to do first is i want to

0:59:58.240,1:00:03.599
check to see if we solve the

1:00:01.280,1:00:04.880
puzzle or not so how do we check to see

1:00:03.599,1:00:07.839
if we solve the puzzle

1:00:04.880,1:00:09.680
well each tile needs to know if it's in

1:00:07.839,1:00:10.960
the correct position or not

1:00:09.680,1:00:13.280
and to do this we're going to use

1:00:10.960,1:00:14.319
something called an array an array is

1:00:13.280,1:00:17.119
new

1:00:14.319,1:00:18.880
so if you go into variables in the past

1:00:17.119,1:00:20.480
we've used all kinds of variables

1:00:18.880,1:00:22.000
we've made a fair number of blocks as

1:00:20.480,1:00:24.079
well but see where it says

1:00:22.000,1:00:25.680
make a list so here's what we're going

1:00:24.079,1:00:28.799
to do

1:00:25.680,1:00:30.480
each of these tiles has a certain x

1:00:28.799,1:00:32.160
position it's supposed to be in

1:00:30.480,1:00:35.599
so this is supposed to be at negative

1:00:32.160,1:00:37.200
120 0 and then positive 120

1:00:35.599,1:00:39.520
they also have a specific y they're

1:00:37.200,1:00:41.200
supposed to be in this top row the y is

1:00:39.520,1:00:44.240
always 120

1:00:41.200,1:00:47.520
and so we're going to make um a

1:00:44.240,1:00:48.480
list of what the correct x's and correct

1:00:47.520,1:00:50.640
y's are

1:00:48.480,1:00:51.920
so go ahead and do this with me go and

1:00:50.640,1:00:53.680
go into your backdrop because that's

1:00:51.920,1:00:56.720
where we're going to be putting the code

1:00:53.680,1:01:00.400
click on make a list so

1:00:56.720,1:01:03.440
this list is going to be the correct

1:01:00.400,1:01:04.720
x i could say correct x values but it's

1:01:03.440,1:01:06.480
going to be correct x

1:01:04.720,1:01:08.079
so this is going to be a list of correct

1:01:06.480,1:01:10.160
x values and it's going to have the

1:01:08.079,1:01:13.520
values like negative 120

1:01:10.160,1:01:16.240
0 positive 120 negative 120 0 positive

1:01:13.520,1:01:18.079
120 negative 120 0 positive 120 so let's

1:01:16.240,1:01:21.359
have nine values total so

1:01:18.079,1:01:22.559
those are the correct x list values

1:01:21.359,1:01:23.839
and you can see it shows up on the

1:01:22.559,1:01:24.799
screen we're going to eventually hide it

1:01:23.839,1:01:26.160
but let's go ahead and

1:01:24.799,1:01:27.520
leave it for now and then we're going to

1:01:26.160,1:01:28.880
make another one this is probably no

1:01:27.520,1:01:32.079
surprise

1:01:28.880,1:01:33.599
called correct y i mean it's going to

1:01:32.079,1:01:35.680
have a list with 9 items and it's going

1:01:33.599,1:01:38.799
to be 120 120 120

1:01:35.680,1:01:39.839
0 0 0 negative 120 negative 120 negative

1:01:38.799,1:01:42.000
120.

1:01:39.839,1:01:44.240
so those are going to be the values so

1:01:42.000,1:01:46.799
we have to make this list

1:01:44.240,1:01:47.839
the easiest way to make this list is to

1:01:46.799,1:01:50.960
cleverly put

1:01:47.839,1:01:51.760
into your code where you should clear

1:01:50.960,1:01:53.680
the array

1:01:51.760,1:01:55.440
and where you should put things in so

1:01:53.680,1:02:00.160
we're going to clear the arrays

1:01:55.440,1:02:02.720
at the very start so to clear the arrays

1:02:00.160,1:02:03.200
we're just going to say delete all of

1:02:02.720,1:02:06.799
correct

1:02:03.200,1:02:08.079
x delete all of correct y

1:02:06.799,1:02:10.160
and so that's going to make sure that

1:02:08.079,1:02:11.359
they start empty so right now they're

1:02:10.160,1:02:12.559
empty but we're going to guarantee they

1:02:11.359,1:02:14.480
start empty

1:02:12.559,1:02:16.400
and then we're going to add things at

1:02:14.480,1:02:20.319
very appropriate

1:02:16.400,1:02:23.920
points so let's do this um i'm going to

1:02:20.319,1:02:26.000
drag over add thing to correct x

1:02:23.920,1:02:27.280
and i'm going to put it inside my add

1:02:26.000,1:02:30.480
row function

1:02:27.280,1:02:31.839
inside the repeat 3 loop just before the

1:02:30.480,1:02:33.520
if statement so you can see where it's

1:02:31.839,1:02:34.799
out there

1:02:33.520,1:02:36.880
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going

1:02:34.799,1:02:40.400
to add

1:02:36.880,1:02:44.240
placement x to the correct

1:02:40.400,1:02:47.440
x list and i'm going to add placement y

1:02:44.240,1:02:48.000
to the correct y list and so my goal

1:02:47.440,1:02:50.400
here is

1:02:48.000,1:02:51.359
that these two lists that you see which

1:02:50.400,1:02:53.680
are currently empty

1:02:51.359,1:02:56.240
they're going to get filled in uh with

1:02:53.680,1:02:58.559
the what are the solution locations

1:02:56.240,1:03:00.000
so when i run it it'll still do like the

1:02:58.559,1:03:01.680
other things in the background

1:03:00.000,1:03:03.520
but the thing i care about is that this

1:03:01.680,1:03:07.119
filled in with a negative 120 0

1:03:03.520,1:03:07.760
120 negative 120 0 120 uh you can see

1:03:07.119,1:03:09.599
the pattern

1:03:07.760,1:03:11.119
and then this one's like the 120s the

1:03:09.599,1:03:14.400
zeros and the negative 120s

1:03:11.119,1:03:15.119
so we've now we know where things should

1:03:14.400,1:03:17.839
be

1:03:15.119,1:03:17.839
now i'm going to hide them

1:03:18.319,1:03:23.920
now what i want to do is once i do a

1:03:20.720,1:03:27.760
glide so i'm going to go over to my tile

1:03:23.920,1:03:29.839
whenever i do a glide i'm going to

1:03:27.760,1:03:31.440
have people count themselves so i'm

1:03:29.839,1:03:31.920
going to say hey how many tiles are

1:03:31.440,1:03:34.000
correct

1:03:31.920,1:03:35.760
so i'm going to broadcast out that

1:03:34.000,1:03:37.359
everybody should count themselves

1:03:35.760,1:03:39.680
and i'm going to make a variable that

1:03:37.359,1:03:41.119
keeps track of how many are correct

1:03:39.680,1:03:44.480
so let's do it then it'll make more

1:03:41.119,1:03:49.760
sense first click on make a variable

1:03:44.480,1:03:49.760
this variable is going to be num correct

1:03:50.160,1:03:54.640
again there's lots of different ways to

1:03:51.760,1:03:55.760
do variables i choose to use camel case

1:03:54.640,1:03:57.599
mush them together

1:03:55.760,1:03:59.599
instead of spelling out the word number

1:03:57.599,1:04:03.280
i just type num correct

1:03:59.599,1:04:04.480
so i've got that variable and whenever i

1:04:03.280,1:04:07.760
glide

1:04:04.480,1:04:11.039
i'm going to set it to zero

1:04:07.760,1:04:14.160
so after a glide i'm going to set

1:04:11.039,1:04:16.319
num correct to zero and then i'm gonna

1:04:14.160,1:04:17.359
broadcast that everybody needs to count

1:04:16.319,1:04:20.799
themselves

1:04:17.359,1:04:22.079
so i'm gonna broadcast a message uh that

1:04:20.799,1:04:25.359
says like

1:04:22.079,1:04:28.160
um check for

1:04:25.359,1:04:29.520
win so everybody's going to count

1:04:28.160,1:04:30.640
themselves we're going to see how many

1:04:29.520,1:04:32.640
of us are correct

1:04:30.640,1:04:34.400
and if there's eight correct then that

1:04:32.640,1:04:36.640
means that we've won the game

1:04:34.400,1:04:37.920
so um let's go ahead and keep going but

1:04:36.640,1:04:38.400
i'm going to check in on my campers

1:04:37.920,1:04:40.400
first

1:04:38.400,1:04:42.160
before i before i do this next step so i

1:04:40.400,1:04:43.599
checked in on my campers and keegan was

1:04:42.160,1:04:45.200
no longer on his computer keegan are you

1:04:43.599,1:04:47.440
calling it done for today

1:04:45.200,1:04:49.119
yup so he was happy with the previous

1:04:47.440,1:04:50.880
thought what about you sis

1:04:49.119,1:04:52.400
i'm adding the extra piece yeah she's

1:04:50.880,1:04:54.400
going strong enough the extra features

1:04:52.400,1:04:56.400
and that did not surprise me

1:04:54.400,1:04:58.240
at all knowing my kiddos but i did want

1:04:56.400,1:04:59.839
to point out that it is okay that if you

1:04:58.240,1:05:02.960
if you chose to stop

1:04:59.839,1:05:04.319
so i've got um numcrack set to zero and

1:05:02.960,1:05:06.720
then i broadcast

1:05:04.319,1:05:08.559
check for win so the idea is i'm just

1:05:06.720,1:05:10.559
screaming hey everybody

1:05:08.559,1:05:12.160
see if you're in the right spot um and

1:05:10.559,1:05:15.359
then we're gonna see how many of us

1:05:12.160,1:05:16.480
are in the right spot so uh down here

1:05:15.359,1:05:20.640
we're gonna have to say

1:05:16.480,1:05:24.400
when i receive so when i receive

1:05:20.640,1:05:25.920
check for a win so all tiles do this

1:05:24.400,1:05:28.079
they have to see if they're in the right

1:05:25.920,1:05:31.760
spot and so what we need to do

1:05:28.079,1:05:34.880
is we need to compare our current

1:05:31.760,1:05:36.319
x and y so we're going to compare our

1:05:34.880,1:05:38.960
current x and y

1:05:36.319,1:05:39.520
to the correct x and y so i'm going to

1:05:38.960,1:05:42.880
go into

1:05:39.520,1:05:44.960
variables i just like to

1:05:42.880,1:05:46.559
get the things that i need right so i

1:05:44.960,1:05:50.319
need

1:05:46.559,1:05:54.240
item 1 of correct x

1:05:50.319,1:05:58.000
and item one of correct y

1:05:54.240,1:05:59.599
now this is a list right there's nine

1:05:58.000,1:06:02.079
different items in there

1:05:59.599,1:06:04.079
i don't always want number one i want

1:06:02.079,1:06:04.640
the appropriate one for my costume

1:06:04.079,1:06:07.119
number

1:06:04.640,1:06:08.799
so like if i'm costume 4 i want to

1:06:07.119,1:06:09.359
compare against the fourth item in the

1:06:08.799,1:06:10.720
array

1:06:09.359,1:06:12.400
so i don't want a one here i want to

1:06:10.720,1:06:16.079
actually go into looks

1:06:12.400,1:06:19.039
and i want my costume number

1:06:16.079,1:06:19.520
so costume number costume number so if

1:06:19.039,1:06:22.960
my

1:06:19.520,1:06:26.880
x is equal to the correct

1:06:22.960,1:06:29.200
x for my costume number and my y

1:06:26.880,1:06:29.920
is equal to the correct y for my costume

1:06:29.200,1:06:32.319
number

1:06:29.920,1:06:33.520
then and only then i can add one to the

1:06:32.319,1:06:35.440
number correct

1:06:33.520,1:06:36.720
so i'm going to need some operators here

1:06:35.440,1:06:38.240
so i'm going to have to check these for

1:06:36.720,1:06:39.280
equality

1:06:38.240,1:06:41.119
so i'm going to go ahead and grab an

1:06:39.280,1:06:43.200
equality here inequality here so i'm

1:06:41.119,1:06:47.520
going to say if my x

1:06:43.200,1:06:50.720
is equal to this and my y

1:06:47.520,1:06:52.799
is equal to that so if that is true and

1:06:50.720,1:06:54.400
that is true so i need an and statement

1:06:52.799,1:06:55.839
now

1:06:54.400,1:06:57.599
again these these things get really

1:06:55.839,1:06:58.160
complex right so you got to grab it from

1:06:57.599,1:07:01.359
like the

1:06:58.160,1:07:03.280
the middle of it so big i can barely

1:07:01.359,1:07:05.119
even see it

1:07:03.280,1:07:07.200
and so and i've got to zoom out so i'm

1:07:05.119,1:07:10.160
just to see my whole thing so if my x

1:07:07.200,1:07:12.000
is equal to the correct x and my y is

1:07:10.160,1:07:14.319
equal to the correct y

1:07:12.000,1:07:16.079
then i can do something so i need an if

1:07:14.319,1:07:19.760
statement

1:07:16.079,1:07:19.760
so i got to grab it from the and

1:07:21.039,1:07:24.319
then what i'm going to do is i'm going

1:07:22.400,1:07:26.079
to report that i was correct and the way

1:07:24.319,1:07:28.079
that i report that i was correct as i go

1:07:26.079,1:07:31.119
to variables

1:07:28.079,1:07:33.680
and i change the number correct

1:07:31.119,1:07:34.559
so num correct by one so you can see

1:07:33.680,1:07:38.000
that

1:07:34.559,1:07:39.520
somebody did a glide he reset it to zero

1:07:38.000,1:07:41.760
and then he told everybody to count

1:07:39.520,1:07:42.000
themselves so let's go ahead and see if

1:07:41.760,1:07:44.240
this

1:07:42.000,1:07:46.160
is working so if i run it now it does

1:07:44.240,1:07:47.839
some shuffling

1:07:46.160,1:07:49.760
if i get my two blank thing i just click

1:07:47.839,1:07:51.520
it again um and so as soon as i do a

1:07:49.760,1:07:54.000
glide so i'm gonna glide the five

1:07:51.520,1:07:54.880
tile over um everybody should count

1:07:54.000,1:07:56.480
themselves

1:07:54.880,1:07:58.799
and so if we look at mine we can see

1:07:56.480,1:08:02.000
that uh 1 2 and 3 are all wrong

1:07:58.799,1:08:03.280
4 5 is correct right here and then 6 7

1:08:02.000,1:08:04.400
and 8 are all wrong

1:08:03.280,1:08:06.240
let's go ahead and do another one i'm

1:08:04.400,1:08:07.440
going to put 4 is in the correct

1:08:06.240,1:08:09.280
position

1:08:07.440,1:08:10.799
and now 7 is in the correct position and

1:08:09.280,1:08:12.079
now as soon as i slide eight over it

1:08:10.799,1:08:14.559
should go up to three so

1:08:12.079,1:08:15.760
test it however you want um but the

1:08:14.559,1:08:17.839
number correct

1:08:15.760,1:08:19.359
should be getting tracked now um if you

1:08:17.839,1:08:20.159
wanted to solve the whole puzzle you

1:08:19.359,1:08:21.520
could

1:08:20.159,1:08:23.520
but that of course takes a little bit of

1:08:21.520,1:08:25.440
time i'm gonna go ahead and solve mine

1:08:23.520,1:08:27.359
just for fun

1:08:25.440,1:08:29.679
i've done these uh algorithms enough

1:08:27.359,1:08:31.359
that i can usually get them done in a

1:08:29.679,1:08:34.719
timely fashion right

1:08:31.359,1:08:37.279
so i'm gonna go ahead and click here

1:08:34.719,1:08:38.239
um and so right there it should be eight

1:08:37.279,1:08:41.359
so there

1:08:38.239,1:08:41.920
num correct is equal to eight nothing

1:08:41.359,1:08:43.359
happened

1:08:41.920,1:08:44.880
when num correct was equal to eight

1:08:43.359,1:08:45.359
because i haven't written that code yet

1:08:44.880,1:08:47.279
right

1:08:45.359,1:08:48.719
so it's all about writing the code to

1:08:47.279,1:08:50.000
make these things happen

1:08:48.719,1:08:52.719
mckimley are you caught up or do you

1:08:50.000,1:08:53.600
fall behind so she's good so we're still

1:08:52.719,1:08:55.600
going strong

1:08:53.600,1:08:56.799
so who's going to check to see if we're

1:08:55.600,1:08:59.440
correct um

1:08:56.799,1:09:00.319
it could actually be about anybody i'm

1:08:59.440,1:09:03.839
going to choose

1:09:00.319,1:09:05.440
for the backdrop to check if i'm correct

1:09:03.839,1:09:07.920
and just because i can i'm going to

1:09:05.440,1:09:11.120
actually just make another

1:09:07.920,1:09:12.799
win green flag clicked over here

1:09:11.120,1:09:14.480
when this green flag is clicked i'm

1:09:12.799,1:09:17.600
going to make sure that my

1:09:14.480,1:09:18.839
num correct variable is set to zero so

1:09:17.600,1:09:22.239
i'm going to say

1:09:18.839,1:09:24.080
set num correct equal to zero

1:09:22.239,1:09:25.520
this is because like when the last game

1:09:24.080,1:09:26.640
finishes if it was eight when the last

1:09:25.520,1:09:28.080
one finishes i want to make sure to

1:09:26.640,1:09:31.839
clear that off

1:09:28.080,1:09:31.839
and i want to forever check

1:09:32.839,1:09:37.279
if the number correct

1:09:37.520,1:09:43.839
is equal to eight so i want to check

1:09:41.600,1:09:46.239
if it's equal to eight i did that really

1:09:43.839,1:09:47.520
fast uh but it's because i think that

1:09:46.239,1:09:48.880
you're kind of getting to the point

1:09:47.520,1:09:49.440
where you can do some of these things

1:09:48.880,1:09:51.679
right

1:09:49.440,1:09:53.440
so i'm not just checking once it's not a

1:09:51.679,1:09:54.159
single if statement i'm just forever

1:09:53.440,1:09:55.920
checking

1:09:54.159,1:09:57.840
to see if the number correct is equal to

1:09:55.920,1:10:01.120
eight if it is

1:09:57.840,1:10:02.800
then i've won the game right um and when

1:10:01.120,1:10:03.440
i win the game i want to do a couple of

1:10:02.800,1:10:05.760
things

1:10:03.440,1:10:07.360
uh one is i need to play a sound that's

1:10:05.760,1:10:09.120
probably the most important

1:10:07.360,1:10:10.480
i think the sound i'm going to play is

1:10:09.120,1:10:17.840
cheer

1:10:10.480,1:10:17.840
so i have to add cheer to my library

1:10:18.000,1:10:21.120
so it's kind of loud but uh but cheer

1:10:20.000,1:10:23.280
worked

1:10:21.120,1:10:24.560
so i i added that to my sounds like

1:10:23.280,1:10:26.159
we've done before and then i'm gonna

1:10:24.560,1:10:28.960
play it over here

1:10:26.159,1:10:31.360
uh so i'm gonna play it until it's done

1:10:28.960,1:10:34.159
so i'm going to play cheer

1:10:31.360,1:10:34.960
i'm also going to bring in the ninth

1:10:34.159,1:10:37.520
tile

1:10:34.960,1:10:38.000
so if you remember when we started this

1:10:37.520,1:10:40.480
lecture

1:10:38.000,1:10:41.360
like an hour ago the way we bring in a

1:10:40.480,1:10:47.040
tile

1:10:41.360,1:10:51.120
is we set um we set three things we set

1:10:47.040,1:10:56.480
the placement x placement x

1:10:51.120,1:10:56.480
the placement y and the costume number

1:10:56.640,1:11:03.280
and then we um create a clone

1:10:59.840,1:11:03.280
which is in control

1:11:03.520,1:11:07.600
again i i brought those in kind of fast

1:11:06.480,1:11:09.679
it's because only

1:11:07.600,1:11:11.360
only like the true troopers have made it

1:11:09.679,1:11:13.440
this far right

1:11:11.360,1:11:14.480
and what i want to set the placement x

1:11:13.440,1:11:16.159
and placement y to

1:11:14.480,1:11:17.920
and the costume number is well the

1:11:16.159,1:11:19.199
costume number is going to be 9

1:11:17.920,1:11:22.400
because that that's going to be where

1:11:19.199,1:11:23.280
it's at and then i want this spot right

1:11:22.400,1:11:25.520
here

1:11:23.280,1:11:27.600
this spot right here is actually saved

1:11:25.520,1:11:30.560
off in the variables

1:11:27.600,1:11:30.560
blank x

1:11:30.960,1:11:35.520
and blank y by the way i don't really

1:11:34.159,1:11:37.040
need to show that number correct so i'm

1:11:35.520,1:11:38.239
going to hit this green check box to get

1:11:37.040,1:11:41.520
rid of it

1:11:38.239,1:11:43.280
so when i win i want to

1:11:41.520,1:11:45.040
load in the ninth tile so i set

1:11:43.280,1:11:46.239
placement x and placement y i set the

1:11:45.040,1:11:48.000
costume number

1:11:46.239,1:11:50.080
i say create clone and that'll actually

1:11:48.000,1:11:53.120
bring him in

1:11:50.080,1:11:54.880
and then i want to play a sound and then

1:11:53.120,1:11:56.640
i'm gonna wait for a minute or wait for

1:11:54.880,1:11:58.000
a few seconds maybe like two or three

1:11:56.640,1:12:01.600
seconds

1:11:58.000,1:12:03.199
um and then i'm gonna stop all

1:12:01.600,1:12:04.880
and i'm just waiting for two or three

1:12:03.199,1:12:06.719
seconds just so you can enjoy the

1:12:04.880,1:12:09.120
victory while you're there

1:12:06.719,1:12:11.520
bob likes for this number to be like a

1:12:09.120,1:12:14.719
full minute so he does like 60 seconds

1:12:11.520,1:12:17.440
whatever you want i'm just going to do

1:12:14.719,1:12:19.440
three seconds because that'll be plenty

1:12:17.440,1:12:21.520
and i think i'm ready to give it a go

1:12:19.440,1:12:23.040
now i will say that in order to test

1:12:21.520,1:12:25.679
this i do have to like get them

1:12:23.040,1:12:26.480
all right to test it so if it fails i'm

1:12:25.679,1:12:29.520
going to like

1:12:26.480,1:12:29.920
really regret how hard it was to test if

1:12:29.520,1:12:32.000
you

1:12:29.920,1:12:33.520
want to test it easier change this

1:12:32.000,1:12:34.320
number eight to like two or something

1:12:33.520,1:12:36.239
like that

1:12:34.320,1:12:38.640
i think that i can do uh do the whole

1:12:36.239,1:12:42.800
thing uh so i'm gonna go ahead and

1:12:38.640,1:12:44.880
just try it alright so i'm almost there

1:12:42.800,1:12:46.239
so as soon as i slide this up uh i

1:12:44.880,1:12:50.000
should be able to see my

1:12:46.239,1:12:52.000
my victory sequence so i slide it up

1:12:50.000,1:12:55.120
it'll work great and then after my three

1:12:52.000,1:12:58.239
seconds uh it goes away

1:12:55.120,1:12:59.600
so i'm going to help my camper out oh

1:12:58.239,1:13:00.560
man i just learned something great from

1:12:59.600,1:13:03.120
mckinley

1:13:00.560,1:13:04.480
so a great way to test this is to

1:13:03.120,1:13:06.320
shuffle it less

1:13:04.480,1:13:08.400
so where it says like repeat 100 or

1:13:06.320,1:13:10.880
something over here just shuffle it like

1:13:08.400,1:13:11.679
three or four times and then play your

1:13:10.880,1:13:13.280
game

1:13:11.679,1:13:15.520
and now it's actually like super easy to

1:13:13.280,1:13:15.520
win

1:13:15.600,1:13:21.120
[ __ ] brilliant nicely done

1:13:18.800,1:13:21.840
so um i think that mine is going pretty

1:13:21.120,1:13:24.880
good

1:13:21.840,1:13:25.840
i'm going to crank this up to 300 now if

1:13:24.880,1:13:26.880
it didn't work

1:13:25.840,1:13:28.400
you're just going to have to look at the

1:13:26.880,1:13:28.960
code that we did recently rewind the

1:13:28.400,1:13:30.800
video

1:13:28.960,1:13:32.320
[ __ ] had a goof here on on correct y

1:13:30.800,1:13:35.199
that we fixed

1:13:32.320,1:13:36.239
but i think that we're ready for the

1:13:35.199,1:13:38.000
last thing

1:13:36.239,1:13:39.600
which is to track how many moves we've

1:13:38.000,1:13:41.120
got so i'm going to go into variables

1:13:39.600,1:13:44.560
i'm going to make my final variable

1:13:41.120,1:13:47.600
called moves i'm going to set

1:13:44.560,1:13:49.920
moves to be zero somewhere again i don't

1:13:47.600,1:13:51.440
really care where you set it to zero

1:13:49.920,1:13:52.719
i'll tell you what i've just been

1:13:51.440,1:13:54.000
goofing around over here so i'll go

1:13:52.719,1:13:58.480
ahead and do this i'm going to say

1:13:54.000,1:14:01.120
set moves to zero

1:13:58.480,1:14:02.560
moves actually i'm going to uh click on

1:14:01.120,1:14:03.280
it here or sorry right click on it and

1:14:02.560,1:14:05.280
say

1:14:03.280,1:14:06.960
large readout just so it's actually it's

1:14:05.280,1:14:08.560
funny that large readout is smaller i

1:14:06.960,1:14:11.280
find that funny

1:14:08.560,1:14:13.600
but every time i move so every time i

1:14:11.280,1:14:15.760
glide a tile

1:14:13.600,1:14:17.280
uh i'm going to increment moves by one

1:14:15.760,1:14:19.280
so i'm going to change

1:14:17.280,1:14:20.960
so every time i do a glide i'm going to

1:14:19.280,1:14:24.239
change moves

1:14:20.960,1:14:26.840
by one now if it

1:14:24.239,1:14:28.400
works mckinley got a messed up somewhere

1:14:26.840,1:14:32.000
question

1:14:28.400,1:14:33.360
all right so i um i went a little too

1:14:32.000,1:14:34.640
fast uh so i'm going to go back and help

1:14:33.360,1:14:36.000
mckinley i'll tell you what i'll just

1:14:34.640,1:14:39.440
i'll just say what i said

1:14:36.000,1:14:41.600
so i created a variable called moves

1:14:39.440,1:14:45.040
i set moves to be 0 somewhere in the

1:14:41.600,1:14:47.520
code i chose to set it to be zero

1:14:45.040,1:14:49.760
on the stage right after a green flag

1:14:47.520,1:14:52.000
check so that just sets it to zero

1:14:49.760,1:14:53.120
and then i increment it when i do a

1:14:52.000,1:14:56.560
glide

1:14:53.120,1:14:58.640
and so the glide happens inside the tile

1:14:56.560,1:14:59.760
right after a glide then i change moves

1:14:58.640,1:15:01.840
by one

1:14:59.760,1:15:04.400
and so now as i move it should just keep

1:15:01.840,1:15:08.320
track of how many moves that i've got

1:15:04.400,1:15:09.840
that fix you up [ __ ] so now

1:15:08.320,1:15:12.480
it's going to like keep track of how

1:15:09.840,1:15:14.719
long i take to do this algorithm

1:15:12.480,1:15:16.880
uh which you know can sometimes be quick

1:15:14.719,1:15:18.320
and it sometimes can be disastrous

1:15:16.880,1:15:20.320
um so i'm gonna go ahead and see if i

1:15:18.320,1:15:22.320
can finish mine and see what it is

1:15:20.320,1:15:24.640
you could also choose to add like a

1:15:22.320,1:15:27.920
fastest time or something like that

1:15:24.640,1:15:29.679
but hey you know what that's up to you

1:15:27.920,1:15:31.600
i i would recommend that you click on

1:15:29.679,1:15:33.840
share

1:15:31.600,1:15:35.760
and so uh if you share it then other

1:15:33.840,1:15:37.360
people can visit it

1:15:35.760,1:15:39.840
looks like it took just a minute to

1:15:37.360,1:15:42.080
share there and then this url you can

1:15:39.840,1:15:44.159
send to friends and family

1:15:42.080,1:15:45.280
and you can see how things work i

1:15:44.159,1:15:47.440
suppose i ought to see

1:15:45.280,1:15:49.760
uh one last time how long it takes to do

1:15:47.440,1:15:50.880
my algorithm here

1:15:49.760,1:15:53.040
all right so i think i've got mine

1:15:50.880,1:15:53.920
towards almost solved uh and so i put it

1:15:53.040,1:15:57.120
together

1:15:53.920,1:15:57.840
um and mine works um what about my

1:15:57.120,1:15:59.840
campers

1:15:57.840,1:16:00.960
uh so campers let's see how you did so

1:15:59.840,1:16:04.239
keegan obviously

1:16:00.960,1:16:06.960
um isn't gonna have the win thing in his

1:16:04.239,1:16:08.320
uh because he chose the uh to finish

1:16:06.960,1:16:08.719
when i said it's fine oh look at that

1:16:08.320,1:16:11.920
picture

1:16:08.719,1:16:12.480
tim and his dog duvy excellent very nice

1:16:11.920,1:16:15.040
i love the

1:16:12.480,1:16:16.960
i love the picture so uh if you ever

1:16:15.040,1:16:18.159
want to do the win thing i can always do

1:16:16.960,1:16:20.239
it with you later okay

1:16:18.159,1:16:22.400
very nice king did you enjoy today's

1:16:20.239,1:16:23.760
yeah do you like the slide puzzle

1:16:22.400,1:16:26.239
was it a little more complicated than

1:16:23.760,1:16:28.080
anything we've ever done before

1:16:26.239,1:16:32.159
all right mckinley let's see yours oh

1:16:28.080,1:16:35.520
she's got uh all these these cool horses

1:16:32.159,1:16:37.760
very nice very nice that's cool

1:16:35.520,1:16:41.760
did you learn some new things today sis

1:16:37.760,1:16:41.760
yeah yeah today was crazy

1:16:42.159,1:16:45.280
all right so i want to say a couple

1:16:43.440,1:16:47.120
things uh and then we'll turn you loose

1:16:45.280,1:16:49.199
uh so the final things that i want to

1:16:47.120,1:16:51.760
say today

1:16:49.199,1:16:53.520
are that you've done a lot of crazy

1:16:51.760,1:16:56.480
things with clones now

1:16:53.520,1:16:58.480
you learn how to use arrays and with

1:16:56.480,1:16:59.679
code you can do a lot more than you

1:16:58.480,1:17:01.520
think right so like

1:16:59.679,1:17:03.520
a complex puzzle like this is totally

1:17:01.520,1:17:05.600
something that scratch can handle

1:17:03.520,1:17:07.040
and it's really kind of cool all right

1:17:05.600,1:17:08.719
go share your link with

1:17:07.040,1:17:11.040
friends and family let them try their

1:17:08.719,1:17:12.480
puzzle don't tell them the algorithm

1:17:11.040,1:17:14.719
right just make them try to figure it

1:17:12.480,1:17:16.480
out and then you can use the algorithm

1:17:14.719,1:17:18.640
and show off

1:17:16.480,1:17:20.239
show off your skills all right loved

1:17:18.640,1:17:22.159
having you can't wait to see you

1:17:20.239,1:17:22.719
tomorrow for the final day of our coding

1:17:22.159,1:17:30.480
camp

1:17:22.719,1:17:30.480
see you then bye
