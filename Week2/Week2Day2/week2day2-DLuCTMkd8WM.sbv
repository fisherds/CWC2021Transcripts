0:00:00.390,0:00:06.160
[Music]

0:00:04.560,0:00:09.280
hey hey welcome back uh

0:00:06.160,0:00:10.400
it's day two of our advanced uh game

0:00:09.280,0:00:12.160
design camp

0:00:10.400,0:00:13.840
uh excited to have you back a lot of

0:00:12.160,0:00:16.320
people fall off after the first day so

0:00:13.840,0:00:17.199
we're excited to have you back so today

0:00:16.320,0:00:19.119
what we're going to do is we're going to

0:00:17.199,0:00:21.680
make a game called dino jump

0:00:19.119,0:00:23.760
it's kind of themed after um there's a

0:00:21.680,0:00:25.519
game called the no internet game

0:00:23.760,0:00:27.519
it's like in chrome if you don't have

0:00:25.519,0:00:28.480
internet there's like a dinosaur there i

0:00:27.519,0:00:30.640
don't know if you've ever discovered

0:00:28.480,0:00:32.320
this it's like this secret in chrome

0:00:30.640,0:00:34.160
and you can jump over cactus and things

0:00:32.320,0:00:35.760
like that so this game is kind of themed

0:00:34.160,0:00:37.520
after that so it's kind of called

0:00:35.760,0:00:39.280
dino jump because of that that

0:00:37.520,0:00:41.840
inspiration it's a little different

0:00:39.280,0:00:43.680
but you can set the idea before we dive

0:00:41.840,0:00:44.960
into today let's kind of recap a couple

0:00:43.680,0:00:47.039
of the things we learned yesterday

0:00:44.960,0:00:48.079
because there were a ton of good skills

0:00:47.039,0:00:50.480
in that first day

0:00:48.079,0:00:51.440
um one of the big ones um that you may

0:00:50.480,0:00:54.160
not have done before

0:00:51.440,0:00:55.039
was clones so mckinley actually found

0:00:54.160,0:00:57.520
clones uh

0:00:55.039,0:00:59.120
new by the way that just reminded me i

0:00:57.520,0:01:00.399
should introduce my campers uh let you

0:00:59.120,0:01:02.239
know who's here with me today all right

0:01:00.399,0:01:05.199
camper number one who are you

0:01:02.239,0:01:06.960
i am keegan keegan you ready to go today

0:01:05.199,0:01:09.040
yeah

0:01:06.960,0:01:10.479
other camper introduce yourself mckinley

0:01:09.040,0:01:13.200
fisher are you uh

0:01:10.479,0:01:14.240
excited about today's game yes all right

0:01:13.200,0:01:14.640
so i just want to let you know that

0:01:14.240,0:01:16.479
they're

0:01:14.640,0:01:17.759
here with me doing things so yesterday

0:01:16.479,0:01:19.280
we learned about clones

0:01:17.759,0:01:21.119
that was even new to mckinley right she

0:01:19.280,0:01:22.960
hadn't done much with clones

0:01:21.119,0:01:24.479
we learned about broadcasting messages

0:01:22.960,0:01:25.119
which is a way for two sprites to

0:01:24.479,0:01:28.159
communicate

0:01:25.119,0:01:29.680
information and there was a bunch of

0:01:28.159,0:01:30.720
other things but i won't go into them

0:01:29.680,0:01:32.320
i mentioned those two because we're

0:01:30.720,0:01:33.439
going to reinforce on those today and

0:01:32.320,0:01:36.000
those are definitely skills that we're

0:01:33.439,0:01:37.520
going to use today as well

0:01:36.000,0:01:39.280
let's start off by looking at a solution

0:01:37.520,0:01:42.399
for what we're going to make

0:01:39.280,0:01:43.920
so this is bob's uh version uh so bob

0:01:42.399,0:01:46.240
schaefer who's the other person in this

0:01:43.920,0:01:47.600
uh but what we're doing is we have uh

0:01:46.240,0:01:50.240
some hero

0:01:47.600,0:01:51.439
and our hero is jumping over um the

0:01:50.240,0:01:54.079
obstacles so you can see it's kind of

0:01:51.439,0:01:57.520
themed after

0:01:54.079,0:01:59.200
kind of themed after uh cactus jump um

0:01:57.520,0:02:00.960
the one difference is if you're noticed

0:01:59.200,0:02:02.079
i can actually go forwards and backwards

0:02:00.960,0:02:03.439
in this game we just think that that

0:02:02.079,0:02:05.119
makes it more fun

0:02:03.439,0:02:07.040
the no internet game doesn't have that

0:02:05.119,0:02:08.160
feature so we have it by the way you can

0:02:07.040,0:02:11.520
also um

0:02:08.160,0:02:13.120
go forwards and backwards midair uh

0:02:11.520,0:02:15.440
that's just to try to make the game more

0:02:13.120,0:02:17.280
fun um but you can see that we're gonna

0:02:15.440,0:02:19.280
do things like simulating gravity

0:02:17.280,0:02:20.879
uh so we're gonna have a jump uh and

0:02:19.280,0:02:22.080
we're gonna simulate gravity gravity is

0:02:20.879,0:02:24.239
a cool thing

0:02:22.080,0:02:25.440
to be able to add to your games but this

0:02:24.239,0:02:27.360
is the goal

0:02:25.440,0:02:29.200
so one thing i do want to say about

0:02:27.360,0:02:32.400
today is that you don't have to use the

0:02:29.200,0:02:32.400
sprites that i have here

0:02:34.400,0:02:38.879
you don't have to use the sprites we

0:02:35.920,0:02:40.480
have here you have to have a hero sprite

0:02:38.879,0:02:41.519
um and you have to have an obstacle you

0:02:40.480,0:02:42.160
jump over and you have to have a

0:02:41.519,0:02:44.000
background

0:02:42.160,0:02:46.080
but they can be whatever you want right

0:02:44.000,0:02:47.680
so there's no no rules on that today so

0:02:46.080,0:02:49.280
think in your head of what your theme is

0:02:47.680,0:02:50.720
going to be and that's going to be

0:02:49.280,0:02:52.480
useful for today

0:02:50.720,0:02:54.160
uh the skills we're going to use are

0:02:52.480,0:02:55.519
learned today we're going to use gravity

0:02:54.160,0:02:56.319
on our sprite so that'll be kind of a

0:02:55.519,0:02:58.480
neat thing

0:02:56.319,0:02:59.840
it's not built in it's not magic oh we

0:02:58.480,0:03:01.280
just have to figure it out and write the

0:02:59.840,0:03:02.720
code for it

0:03:01.280,0:03:03.920
we're going to use random numbers we're

0:03:02.720,0:03:05.920
going to play sounds we're going to do

0:03:03.920,0:03:08.560
more with broadcasting events

0:03:05.920,0:03:10.000
and then publishing our games as well

0:03:08.560,0:03:11.680
since one of the core

0:03:10.000,0:03:14.159
things of this game is gravity i thought

0:03:11.680,0:03:16.159
i'd talk about gravity just a little bit

0:03:14.159,0:03:17.599
gravity which is also called an

0:03:16.159,0:03:19.680
acceleration

0:03:17.599,0:03:21.519
it's the force that's put on all bodies

0:03:19.680,0:03:22.239
so they fall right so people know about

0:03:21.519,0:03:24.640
gravity

0:03:22.239,0:03:26.480
since you're a little kid right and the

0:03:24.640,0:03:28.799
idea is is that here's a person

0:03:26.480,0:03:29.920
who's apparently a stunt man jumping off

0:03:28.799,0:03:32.480
a building into an

0:03:29.920,0:03:33.760
airbag right and the idea with gravity

0:03:32.480,0:03:36.080
is that he jumps

0:03:33.760,0:03:37.920
at one point and he has a velocity of

0:03:36.080,0:03:39.840
zero

0:03:37.920,0:03:41.599
and after he starts falling after one

0:03:39.840,0:03:43.120
second he's falling at a certain speed

0:03:41.599,0:03:45.519
he's falling like 10

0:03:43.120,0:03:47.440
meters per second here and then as he

0:03:45.519,0:03:50.159
falls like as he continues to fall

0:03:47.440,0:03:52.239
he actually falls not just down but he

0:03:50.159,0:03:54.560
falls faster and faster

0:03:52.239,0:03:56.080
as he goes down and you'll your eyes are

0:03:54.560,0:03:56.720
used to seeing it so like there's this

0:03:56.080,0:03:58.879
natural

0:03:56.720,0:04:00.080
um kind of slow at the top and then fast

0:03:58.879,0:04:02.560
at the bottom and we're going to

0:04:00.080,0:04:05.280
simulate gravity uh in our games

0:04:02.560,0:04:06.560
he's throwing a bowl all right so keegan

0:04:05.280,0:04:08.080
corrected me he said he's throwing a

0:04:06.560,0:04:08.560
ball he's not jumping he's just throwing

0:04:08.080,0:04:11.280
a ball

0:04:08.560,0:04:12.239
that makes a lot more sense all right

0:04:11.280,0:04:16.160
moving on

0:04:12.239,0:04:17.919
so uh go visit scratch.mit.edu

0:04:16.160,0:04:20.880
so here i'm on scratch uh click on

0:04:17.919,0:04:22.400
create to start a new game

0:04:20.880,0:04:24.240
uh sometimes you can play your old game

0:04:22.400,0:04:26.400
for a little bit before you start today

0:04:24.240,0:04:28.240
but you can pick a new game and then the

0:04:26.400,0:04:30.479
first thing to do is to pick your

0:04:28.240,0:04:32.400
your three items uh you can see in the

0:04:30.479,0:04:33.520
solution here we had a cat jumping over

0:04:32.400,0:04:35.520
a dinosaur

0:04:33.520,0:04:37.280
um but you can actually do anything that

0:04:35.520,0:04:38.400
you want uh so i'm actually going to

0:04:37.280,0:04:41.280
start off by

0:04:38.400,0:04:42.320
deleting my cat and then adding some

0:04:41.280,0:04:44.080
other sprite

0:04:42.320,0:04:45.840
so one way you can add sprites is of

0:04:44.080,0:04:47.520
course from the sprite library

0:04:45.840,0:04:48.800
uh the sprite library when you hover

0:04:47.520,0:04:49.600
over this you can just click on the

0:04:48.800,0:04:50.880
circle

0:04:49.600,0:04:52.240
or you can click on this magnifying

0:04:50.880,0:04:53.280
glass they actually do the same thing

0:04:52.240,0:04:54.400
choose a sprite

0:04:53.280,0:04:55.680
i'm going to do that for one of my

0:04:54.400,0:04:56.720
sprites and then for one of the others

0:04:55.680,0:04:58.720
i'm going to upload

0:04:56.720,0:04:59.840
just kind of show you how it works so i

0:04:58.720,0:05:01.199
think what i'm going to do

0:04:59.840,0:05:05.520
is i'm going to go ahead and use a

0:05:01.199,0:05:07.280
dinosaur i kind of like this dinosaur

0:05:05.520,0:05:08.720
but i'm going to switch it from the

0:05:07.280,0:05:10.320
solution and instead of

0:05:08.720,0:05:11.840
my dinosaur being the thing that gets

0:05:10.320,0:05:13.919
jumped over

0:05:11.840,0:05:15.199
my dinosaur is going to do the jumping

0:05:13.919,0:05:17.360
so it's going to kind of be like

0:05:15.199,0:05:18.800
the dinosaur theme and then the thing i

0:05:17.360,0:05:20.000
want to jump over is i want to jump over

0:05:18.800,0:05:22.000
a cactus

0:05:20.000,0:05:23.680
now the first thing you should do is you

0:05:22.000,0:05:24.000
should see is hey is there a cactus

0:05:23.680,0:05:26.560
built

0:05:24.000,0:05:27.759
into the library well there's not right

0:05:26.560,0:05:29.199
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:05:27.759,0:05:31.280
go search the internet

0:05:29.199,0:05:32.960
for an image of a cactus and then i'm

0:05:31.280,0:05:35.360
going to bring it into the game

0:05:32.960,0:05:36.560
so to search the internet for a cactus

0:05:35.360,0:05:39.680
what you should do is you should do a

0:05:36.560,0:05:41.840
google search for cactus

0:05:39.680,0:05:43.840
and then what i want is i want images of

0:05:41.840,0:05:44.880
cactus so in google you can click on

0:05:43.840,0:05:47.440
images here

0:05:44.880,0:05:49.680
so now it shows you a bunch of images of

0:05:47.440,0:05:52.080
different cacti

0:05:49.680,0:05:53.680
for scratch games we don't want so like

0:05:52.080,0:05:56.080
see how this one has a

0:05:53.680,0:05:57.039
square rectangle sorry a rectangle

0:05:56.080,0:05:58.479
that's solid

0:05:57.039,0:05:59.919
that would not look very good in our

0:05:58.479,0:06:02.400
game what we want is we want something

0:05:59.919,0:06:04.080
with a background of transparent

0:06:02.400,0:06:07.360
so you can do that in google so you

0:06:04.080,0:06:10.479
click on tools

0:06:07.360,0:06:12.720
color transparent yeah

0:06:10.479,0:06:14.000
so my kids know this game this came

0:06:12.720,0:06:17.360
really well

0:06:14.000,0:06:19.520
and so this will give you images

0:06:17.360,0:06:20.960
that have transparent backgrounds and

0:06:19.520,0:06:21.919
now you can go through and you can find

0:06:20.960,0:06:23.520
what you want

0:06:21.919,0:06:24.560
um other tricks you can use by the way

0:06:23.520,0:06:26.000
is if you kind of want something with a

0:06:24.560,0:06:28.560
more cartoony look

0:06:26.000,0:06:29.600
uh and type you can go to clip art and

0:06:28.560,0:06:31.199
it'll give you kind of like more

0:06:29.600,0:06:33.120
cartoony things sometimes

0:06:31.199,0:06:34.560
cartoony drawings look better in scratch

0:06:33.120,0:06:36.720
because it goes with um

0:06:34.560,0:06:37.840
with the built-in sprites better and you

0:06:36.720,0:06:40.560
can just find

0:06:37.840,0:06:42.720
a cactus that you want um so i'm just

0:06:40.560,0:06:44.479
going to click on this one

0:06:42.720,0:06:45.840
you hope that it really does have a

0:06:44.479,0:06:47.520
transparent background that should show

0:06:45.840,0:06:49.120
up as this checkerboard pattern

0:06:47.520,0:06:51.280
some people on the internet are tricky

0:06:49.120,0:06:52.720
though they put a real black and white

0:06:51.280,0:06:53.919
background on there to make it look like

0:06:52.720,0:06:55.120
it's transparent

0:06:53.919,0:06:57.360
we're just going to hope that it worked

0:06:55.120,0:06:58.720
out and then what i do is i right click

0:06:57.360,0:07:02.560
on it and i say

0:06:58.720,0:07:03.440
save image as and i'm just going to call

0:07:02.560,0:07:07.599
it

0:07:03.440,0:07:09.120
cactus and then in my game

0:07:07.599,0:07:10.639
i'm going to come over here to choose a

0:07:09.120,0:07:12.160
sprite but instead of just clicking the

0:07:10.639,0:07:15.280
circle i'm going to use this

0:07:12.160,0:07:16.000
top one which says upload sprite and i'm

0:07:15.280,0:07:18.960
going to select

0:07:16.000,0:07:20.240
that cactus now you never know what size

0:07:18.960,0:07:22.080
it's going to come in

0:07:20.240,0:07:24.160
it doesn't matter if it comes in huge

0:07:22.080,0:07:25.440
that's really no big deal

0:07:24.160,0:07:28.160
because you can always just go to the

0:07:25.440,0:07:30.160
size here and you can make it smaller

0:07:28.160,0:07:32.000
so for mine i'm gonna have to make it

0:07:30.160,0:07:34.000
smaller still

0:07:32.000,0:07:36.160
um i guess i'll make it about that big

0:07:34.000,0:07:37.759
that seems that seems about right

0:07:36.160,0:07:39.520
so my dinosaur is gonna have to jump

0:07:37.759,0:07:41.440
over these uh different cactus

0:07:39.520,0:07:43.440
and you can play with your size uh until

0:07:41.440,0:07:44.879
you're happy with things

0:07:43.440,0:07:47.680
yeah he's about right maybe i'll make my

0:07:44.879,0:07:49.280
dinosaur a little bigger

0:07:47.680,0:07:51.280
uh cool all right so i think that i'm

0:07:49.280,0:07:53.440
happy with this uh i need oh i need a

0:07:51.280,0:07:56.319
backdrop is what i need

0:07:53.440,0:07:57.919
so let's go ahead and open up backdrops

0:07:56.319,0:07:59.680
so the backdrop you can actually click

0:07:57.919,0:08:01.759
right here on choose a backdrop

0:07:59.680,0:08:03.120
um or you can come over here to costumes

0:08:01.759,0:08:03.680
and you can click on choose a backdrop

0:08:03.120,0:08:05.360
over here

0:08:03.680,0:08:06.879
it's funny it's for backdrop it's

0:08:05.360,0:08:08.160
basically the same button regardless of

0:08:06.879,0:08:09.520
which side you use

0:08:08.160,0:08:12.240
um and i'm going to just go ahead and

0:08:09.520,0:08:12.800
put in uh the desert theme uh that fit

0:08:12.240,0:08:15.360
pretty well

0:08:12.800,0:08:16.639
uh with what i'm after all right so at

0:08:15.360,0:08:19.919
this point i've got

0:08:16.639,0:08:21.199
uh my cactus i've got my dinosaur

0:08:19.919,0:08:23.039
and what i want to do is i want you to

0:08:21.199,0:08:24.800
kind of set them uh where you think

0:08:23.039,0:08:26.800
ground level should be

0:08:24.800,0:08:28.000
so i'm going to put my cactus right

0:08:26.800,0:08:28.720
there towards kind of planting the

0:08:28.000,0:08:30.800
ground

0:08:28.720,0:08:32.560
and my dinosaur toward his feet are just

0:08:30.800,0:08:34.240
barely on the ground

0:08:32.560,0:08:35.599
now i'm ready to come in and start my

0:08:34.240,0:08:38.800
code

0:08:35.599,0:08:41.279
so the first thing we want to do for

0:08:38.800,0:08:42.240
our hero so whatever's doing the jumping

0:08:41.279,0:08:43.760
so my hero

0:08:42.240,0:08:46.320
is the dinosaur he's going to be doing

0:08:43.760,0:08:48.560
the jumping is we want him to

0:08:46.320,0:08:50.000
uh do things when the green flag is

0:08:48.560,0:08:51.440
clicked

0:08:50.000,0:08:53.760
and what we're actually going to focus

0:08:51.440,0:08:55.760
on first with him is uh

0:08:53.760,0:08:58.080
falling right so we want him to to be

0:08:55.760,0:09:00.640
good at falling

0:08:58.080,0:09:02.080
falling is something that's going to

0:09:00.640,0:09:03.279
happen to where his y position is going

0:09:02.080,0:09:05.839
to change

0:09:03.279,0:09:07.360
up until he gets to ground level right

0:09:05.839,0:09:08.480
and when he gets to ground level he

0:09:07.360,0:09:10.560
stops

0:09:08.480,0:09:12.000
right now uh make sure your hero is

0:09:10.560,0:09:15.040
selected and look at the

0:09:12.000,0:09:16.800
the y value in here so your y value will

0:09:15.040,0:09:20.839
be different than mine

0:09:16.800,0:09:23.839
but for me my ground level is negative

0:09:20.839,0:09:25.279
115. so find yours and figure it out

0:09:23.839,0:09:26.399
that number is going to be useful

0:09:25.279,0:09:27.360
throughout our game so what i'm going to

0:09:26.399,0:09:28.880
do is i'm actually going to make a

0:09:27.360,0:09:30.800
variable

0:09:28.880,0:09:33.279
so click on variables then click on make

0:09:30.800,0:09:35.760
a variable

0:09:33.279,0:09:37.440
you can say for this sprite only so this

0:09:35.760,0:09:38.560
variable is going to be for the ground

0:09:37.440,0:09:41.360
level

0:09:38.560,0:09:42.000
and it really only affects this one one

0:09:41.360,0:09:44.399
sprite

0:09:42.000,0:09:46.720
and i'm just going to call it ground

0:09:44.399,0:09:48.240
level

0:09:46.720,0:09:50.320
you can see how i like to name my

0:09:48.240,0:09:51.200
variables i like to leave no spaces and

0:09:50.320,0:09:54.080
capitalize

0:09:51.200,0:09:54.640
the next level next letter it's just a

0:09:54.080,0:09:55.920
choice

0:09:54.640,0:09:58.399
that i choose to make but you really

0:09:55.920,0:10:00.560
could do just about anything

0:09:58.399,0:10:02.160
ground level defaults by being displayed

0:10:00.560,0:10:03.120
on the screen i don't want it displayed

0:10:02.160,0:10:04.560
on the screen

0:10:03.120,0:10:06.800
so i'm going to hit this check box and

0:10:04.560,0:10:08.320
not have it get displayed on the screen

0:10:06.800,0:10:09.680
and this variable is kind of a funny

0:10:08.320,0:10:11.680
variable because i'm just going to set

0:10:09.680,0:10:15.360
it one time

0:10:11.680,0:10:17.040
to negative 115 for me

0:10:15.360,0:10:18.560
and i'm just going to use that variable

0:10:17.040,0:10:20.079
a couple times so variables have a

0:10:18.560,0:10:22.720
couple different purposes

0:10:20.079,0:10:25.200
sometimes they're used as something you

0:10:22.720,0:10:26.399
like set and change like a score keeper

0:10:25.200,0:10:28.480
we're going to use the score keeper in

0:10:26.399,0:10:30.160
this game as well

0:10:28.480,0:10:31.600
but this variable is a little different

0:10:30.160,0:10:33.680
this variable is what's called it's to

0:10:31.600,0:10:35.440
help me avoid magic numbers in my code

0:10:33.680,0:10:36.320
so instead of having this magic negative

0:10:35.440,0:10:38.240
115

0:10:36.320,0:10:40.000
appear like different places in my code

0:10:38.240,0:10:42.880
i'm making it once as variable

0:10:40.000,0:10:43.600
all right long speech for for not much

0:10:42.880,0:10:45.360
good there

0:10:43.600,0:10:46.880
so let's go ahead and have the the

0:10:45.360,0:10:49.279
dinosaur

0:10:46.880,0:10:50.160
start in some position so i like to

0:10:49.279,0:10:53.200
always make him

0:10:50.160,0:10:55.279
start at a certain x y

0:10:53.200,0:10:57.600
so if i put this in he's of course going

0:10:55.279,0:11:00.000
to start at ground level which is fine

0:10:57.600,0:11:02.640
since we're currently simulating falling

0:11:00.000,0:11:04.560
i'm going to actually start him up here

0:11:02.640,0:11:06.399
just so that we can practice with with

0:11:04.560,0:11:08.640
falling right

0:11:06.399,0:11:10.399
so up there you can see now his y is 72

0:11:08.640,0:11:13.920
so i'm going to say make his y be

0:11:10.399,0:11:15.519
72. all right to make him fall we're

0:11:13.920,0:11:16.800
going to need a forever loop

0:11:15.519,0:11:20.240
so let's just go ahead and grab a

0:11:16.800,0:11:20.240
forever loop and drag it over

0:11:21.200,0:11:24.640
um and in this forever loop what we want

0:11:23.040,0:11:27.600
to do is we want his

0:11:24.640,0:11:29.600
y to get smaller and smaller and smaller

0:11:27.600,0:11:33.360
so in motion

0:11:29.600,0:11:37.760
let's go ahead and find change y by

0:11:33.360,0:11:39.279
so change y by

0:11:37.760,0:11:40.880
and right now to start things off we're

0:11:39.279,0:11:43.040
just going to say negative 1. so we're

0:11:40.880,0:11:45.760
going to change the y by negative one

0:11:43.040,0:11:47.279
every time this loop goes around if you

0:11:45.760,0:11:49.760
were to run it now

0:11:47.279,0:11:52.720
he would start falling right so he's

0:11:49.760,0:11:55.519
falling at a very slow speed

0:11:52.720,0:11:57.440
and he's falling at a very constant rate

0:11:55.519,0:11:58.079
and he does not stop when he hits the

0:11:57.440,0:11:59.920
ground

0:11:58.079,0:12:01.920
he does stop before he goes off the

0:11:59.920,0:12:03.680
screen that's a feature that scratch

0:12:01.920,0:12:05.200
does to try to be friendlier to you

0:12:03.680,0:12:06.639
it won't let you push things off the

0:12:05.200,0:12:07.760
screen because it's very confusing like

0:12:06.639,0:12:11.120
where did it go

0:12:07.760,0:12:12.000
um so it's a start right so it's too

0:12:11.120,0:12:14.560
slow

0:12:12.000,0:12:16.639
um and it doesn't use gravity because

0:12:14.560,0:12:17.760
it's a constant velocity which is not

0:12:16.639,0:12:19.200
how gravity works

0:12:17.760,0:12:21.519
and it doesn't stop the bottom so we got

0:12:19.200,0:12:23.519
to fix all these things

0:12:21.519,0:12:24.800
let's fix them one at a time let's fix

0:12:23.519,0:12:26.480
um let's fix

0:12:24.800,0:12:27.839
doesn't fall through the ground first

0:12:26.480,0:12:29.600
right so

0:12:27.839,0:12:31.279
for doesn't fall through the ground uh

0:12:29.600,0:12:32.560
what i want to do is i like to practice

0:12:31.279,0:12:35.279
with functions

0:12:32.560,0:12:37.360
we're going to make a function so click

0:12:35.279,0:12:40.480
on my blocks

0:12:37.360,0:12:41.680
click on make a block

0:12:40.480,0:12:44.399
and we're just going to call this

0:12:41.680,0:12:46.880
function check for

0:12:44.399,0:12:46.880
ground

0:12:49.279,0:12:53.200
we didn't have to make a function here

0:12:51.760,0:12:54.560
but i just like to practice with

0:12:53.200,0:12:57.279
functions right

0:12:54.560,0:12:59.040
so the ideas with functions is um you

0:12:57.279,0:13:01.360
know after you do your movement

0:12:59.040,0:13:03.519
then you check for the grounds so this

0:13:01.360,0:13:04.720
calls the function

0:13:03.519,0:13:06.480
and then the things that are going to be

0:13:04.720,0:13:07.680
inside the function is it's just going

0:13:06.480,0:13:10.480
to check the y

0:13:07.680,0:13:11.279
to see if it's below ground level right

0:13:10.480,0:13:14.079
so to check

0:13:11.279,0:13:15.040
something we need an if statement so

0:13:14.079,0:13:18.240
we're just going to say

0:13:15.040,0:13:19.360
if and the thing we want to check is we

0:13:18.240,0:13:21.839
want to check my y

0:13:19.360,0:13:22.800
value to see if it's less than ground

0:13:21.839,0:13:26.800
level

0:13:22.800,0:13:29.519
so we need an operator to do a greater

0:13:26.800,0:13:29.519
than less than

0:13:30.240,0:13:35.839
and if my y y is a built-in variable

0:13:33.680,0:13:38.240
it's inside motion

0:13:35.839,0:13:40.240
so y position is what it's called so if

0:13:38.240,0:13:43.440
my y position

0:13:40.240,0:13:48.000
is less than ground level i've got a

0:13:43.440,0:13:49.760
variable for ground level

0:13:48.000,0:13:51.040
so if that ever happens that means i'm

0:13:49.760,0:13:53.680
below ground

0:13:51.040,0:13:54.639
then i want to set my y to be ground

0:13:53.680,0:13:58.079
level

0:13:54.639,0:14:01.199
so i'm going to go to motion

0:13:58.079,0:14:04.240
and i'm going to find set y

0:14:01.199,0:14:04.240
oops where's set y

0:14:04.320,0:14:08.880
and i'm going to set it to this variable

0:14:06.639,0:14:12.079
ground level

0:14:08.880,0:14:13.680
and you can see how using this variable

0:14:12.079,0:14:15.600
makes your code more readable right

0:14:13.680,0:14:18.639
because i mean if you read this it says

0:14:15.600,0:14:19.519
check for ground if y position less than

0:14:18.639,0:14:22.480
ground level

0:14:19.519,0:14:22.800
so if you're less than ground level then

0:14:22.480,0:14:25.839
set

0:14:22.800,0:14:27.680
y to ground level and i really like how

0:14:25.839,0:14:28.399
scratch does a nice job of naming the

0:14:27.680,0:14:29.680
blocks

0:14:28.399,0:14:32.959
to where you kind of know what's going

0:14:29.680,0:14:34.399
to happen just based on reading them

0:14:32.959,0:14:37.440
so you can see that when i ran at this

0:14:34.399,0:14:40.079
time he again very slowly fell

0:14:37.440,0:14:41.839
but he stopped when he got to the ground

0:14:40.079,0:14:44.320
does that sound good

0:14:41.839,0:14:45.600
campers are you doing all right all

0:14:44.320,0:14:46.639
right i'm gonna pause for a second help

0:14:45.600,0:14:48.079
my campers

0:14:46.639,0:14:49.600
all right i checked in my campers that

0:14:48.079,0:14:51.199
are doing good i'm excited about their

0:14:49.600,0:14:52.320
themes i'll show you i'll show you what

0:14:51.199,0:14:53.760
they're up to later

0:14:52.320,0:14:55.600
all right so the next thing i want to do

0:14:53.760,0:14:57.440
is i want to actually uh you know

0:14:55.600,0:15:00.320
simulate how gravity works right

0:14:57.440,0:15:00.800
where the velocity actually gets bigger

0:15:00.320,0:15:02.639
uh

0:15:00.800,0:15:04.320
the farther you go down instead of the

0:15:02.639,0:15:05.920
word velocity which is the word that i

0:15:04.320,0:15:08.240
like to use that's the technical term

0:15:05.920,0:15:09.600
let's just call it fall speed so first

0:15:08.240,0:15:12.000
thing i want to do is over here i want

0:15:09.600,0:15:14.880
to make a variable

0:15:12.000,0:15:16.959
i'm going to call it fall speed i'll

0:15:14.880,0:15:19.519
tell you what since i

0:15:16.959,0:15:20.720
am going to show this to the world i'm

0:15:19.519,0:15:22.079
going to put it on the screen

0:15:20.720,0:15:23.680
i'm going to name it differently right

0:15:22.079,0:15:24.160
so this is how i name things when

0:15:23.680,0:15:26.720
they're like

0:15:24.160,0:15:27.680
visible to the world so this is my fall

0:15:26.720,0:15:31.040
speed

0:15:27.680,0:15:32.399
also this variable is literally just for

0:15:31.040,0:15:34.000
this sprite

0:15:32.399,0:15:36.320
but i'm going to do something tricky i'm

0:15:34.000,0:15:37.839
going to say it's for all sprites

0:15:36.320,0:15:40.000
just because whenever you put it on the

0:15:37.839,0:15:41.680
screen it's super ugly if you say

0:15:40.000,0:15:43.759
for all sprites you can see it's like

0:15:41.680,0:15:46.000
dinosaur four colon blah blah blah blah

0:15:43.759,0:15:47.120
so i'm gonna say it's for all sprites

0:15:46.000,0:15:49.040
even though it's not

0:15:47.120,0:15:50.399
um just so that when it displays up here

0:15:49.040,0:15:51.680
it displays prettier

0:15:50.399,0:15:54.000
so that's another reason you might want

0:15:51.680,0:15:54.399
to do for all sprites all right so i'm

0:15:54.000,0:15:57.680
going to

0:15:54.399,0:15:58.880
set the full speed to be initially zero

0:15:57.680,0:16:02.000
so i'm just going to do that right at

0:15:58.880,0:16:02.560
the top so the fall speed is zero so

0:16:02.000,0:16:04.480
he's not

0:16:02.560,0:16:07.120
he's not falling he's not jumping he's

0:16:04.480,0:16:08.639
just not moving right now

0:16:07.120,0:16:11.440
and then what i'm going to do is i'm

0:16:08.639,0:16:14.160
going to inside the forever loop

0:16:11.440,0:16:15.680
i'm going to change the fall speed by

0:16:14.160,0:16:17.839
negative one

0:16:15.680,0:16:18.880
and so what that does is that means that

0:16:17.839,0:16:21.040
you

0:16:18.880,0:16:22.160
fall faster and faster and faster the

0:16:21.040,0:16:24.320
longer you fall

0:16:22.160,0:16:25.440
so that makes like this value is 10 here

0:16:24.320,0:16:26.560
and then by the time it gets down to

0:16:25.440,0:16:28.880
here it's 20.

0:16:26.560,0:16:30.160
so my fall speed just gets faster and

0:16:28.880,0:16:32.959
faster and faster

0:16:30.160,0:16:34.079
and then i'm going to change y by my

0:16:32.959,0:16:36.560
fall speed

0:16:34.079,0:16:37.680
so that y changes depending on what the

0:16:36.560,0:16:39.120
full speed is

0:16:37.680,0:16:42.000
uh and so now it'll be a subtle

0:16:39.120,0:16:45.279
difference but as you uh click play

0:16:42.000,0:16:48.320
um your hero will actually start falling

0:16:45.279,0:16:50.320
um faster the longer he falls um if you

0:16:48.320,0:16:52.480
want to start them even higher uh maybe

0:16:50.320,0:16:55.600
i'll start him at like 160.

0:16:52.480,0:16:57.199
maybe i could see it better um but he

0:16:55.600,0:16:59.920
actually like kind of has this like

0:16:57.199,0:17:01.519
acceleration as he gets to the ground

0:16:59.920,0:17:04.959
now there is a problem if you're

0:17:01.519,0:17:07.679
watching closely the fall speed um

0:17:04.959,0:17:10.000
claims to keep going right and that's

0:17:07.679,0:17:11.679
just because that's what our code did

0:17:10.000,0:17:13.280
and the trick is is that it claims to

0:17:11.679,0:17:15.039
keep going but he doesn't move because

0:17:13.280,0:17:16.640
we have check for ground in here

0:17:15.039,0:17:18.240
that does kind of bug me though that

0:17:16.640,0:17:20.079
that number is going out of control

0:17:18.240,0:17:22.319
so we will fix it don't don't worry

0:17:20.079,0:17:24.000
about that we will fix it

0:17:22.319,0:17:26.880
before we fix it though i actually want

0:17:24.000,0:17:28.400
to do a left and right motion first

0:17:26.880,0:17:29.760
so like if i hit left arrow nothing

0:17:28.400,0:17:30.320
happens if i hit right arrow nothing

0:17:29.760,0:17:31.760
happens

0:17:30.320,0:17:35.039
i'm going to fix that first and then i'm

0:17:31.760,0:17:37.600
going to come back and fix this problem

0:17:35.039,0:17:39.360
so left and right arrow we need to check

0:17:37.600,0:17:42.480
if you're pressing the left arrow

0:17:39.360,0:17:44.559
or if you're pressing the right arrow so

0:17:42.480,0:17:46.559
see if you can do this one on your own

0:17:44.559,0:17:48.320
so for the dinosaur

0:17:46.559,0:17:49.840
and what i want you to do is if you are

0:17:48.320,0:17:52.880
pressing the left arrow

0:17:49.840,0:17:54.240
then i want you to change your x by some

0:17:52.880,0:17:55.520
negative amount

0:17:54.240,0:17:57.919
and if you're pressing the right arrow

0:17:55.520,0:17:59.120
change your x by some positive amount

0:17:57.919,0:18:01.840
see if you can do this one all by

0:17:59.120,0:18:01.840
yourself

0:18:02.320,0:18:06.000
all right so so my camper's got it but i

0:18:04.080,0:18:07.840
did have to to help a little bit

0:18:06.000,0:18:09.360
i'm not expecting if you're new to this

0:18:07.840,0:18:10.559
for you to be able to do it on your own

0:18:09.360,0:18:12.720
i just wanted you to try

0:18:10.559,0:18:14.480
right um but the idea is is that we're

0:18:12.720,0:18:15.760
going to need two if statements

0:18:14.480,0:18:17.440
i'm going to go ahead and drop my if

0:18:15.760,0:18:18.480
statements right into the forever loop

0:18:17.440,0:18:22.240
here

0:18:18.480,0:18:22.240
and so we're going to need to check for

0:18:22.400,0:18:26.400
left key press and right key press so

0:18:25.360,0:18:28.000
left and right

0:18:26.400,0:18:30.160
this is actually very similar to what we

0:18:28.000,0:18:31.600
did last time checking for left and

0:18:30.160,0:18:32.880
right arrows

0:18:31.600,0:18:35.760
and then what we're going to do is we're

0:18:32.880,0:18:38.640
going to change the x

0:18:35.760,0:18:39.600
by some amount you could also use the

0:18:38.640,0:18:42.320
move by

0:18:39.600,0:18:42.960
but i choose to to do change x and y so

0:18:42.320,0:18:46.400
i don't change

0:18:42.960,0:18:49.520
directions right so left should be a

0:18:46.400,0:18:50.160
negative and then i can can give it a go

0:18:49.520,0:18:51.600
so

0:18:50.160,0:18:53.520
i should be able to press the right

0:18:51.600,0:18:54.960
arrow key and move

0:18:53.520,0:18:56.880
to the right and the left arrow key and

0:18:54.960,0:18:58.160
move to the left by the way keegan

0:18:56.880,0:19:00.559
mentioned that you can actually

0:18:58.160,0:19:01.600
uh move while you're falling uh he says

0:19:00.559,0:19:03.840
that that's not how

0:19:01.600,0:19:05.600
you know physics really works um and i

0:19:03.840,0:19:06.320
said that's how our game works uh so

0:19:05.600,0:19:08.720
moving

0:19:06.320,0:19:10.080
while falling makes it more fun right so

0:19:08.720,0:19:11.679
just kind of know that

0:19:10.080,0:19:13.280
that is how we choose to implement our

0:19:11.679,0:19:15.039
game

0:19:13.280,0:19:16.480
all right so now we're going to fix this

0:19:15.039,0:19:18.720
problem of

0:19:16.480,0:19:19.600
we keep falling even when we're on the

0:19:18.720,0:19:20.720
ground

0:19:19.600,0:19:23.039
this is actually going to be the

0:19:20.720,0:19:25.360
trickiest part of today's code

0:19:23.039,0:19:26.640
because it's going to involve shuffling

0:19:25.360,0:19:28.640
around our code some

0:19:26.640,0:19:29.840
right so here's what i want you to do i

0:19:28.640,0:19:31.919
want to shuffle around

0:19:29.840,0:19:33.440
the code sum what i want to do is the

0:19:31.919,0:19:34.559
thing that makes you fall is these two

0:19:33.440,0:19:37.200
lines here this

0:19:34.559,0:19:38.960
change fall speed by negative 1 and this

0:19:37.200,0:19:40.080
change y by fall speed

0:19:38.960,0:19:41.919
and so what i want to do is i want to

0:19:40.080,0:19:42.640
pull those two out and set them over

0:19:41.919,0:19:44.000
here

0:19:42.640,0:19:45.840
and then just leave everything else

0:19:44.000,0:19:46.960
alone so what i'm going to choose to do

0:19:45.840,0:19:49.360
is i'm going to choose to drag

0:19:46.960,0:19:50.080
everything over and then i'm going to

0:19:49.360,0:19:52.799
put back

0:19:50.080,0:19:54.720
just this part so now i kind of have

0:19:52.799,0:19:57.120
this this hanging out over here

0:19:54.720,0:19:58.480
if i were to run my code right now uh it

0:19:57.120,0:20:00.320
would not really work very well because

0:19:58.480,0:20:01.919
i would no longer be falling i could

0:20:00.320,0:20:02.799
still go to the left and right when i'm

0:20:01.919,0:20:05.760
way up here

0:20:02.799,0:20:07.280
but i took out falling temporarily right

0:20:05.760,0:20:09.280
we're going to put it back

0:20:07.280,0:20:11.280
so now what i want to do to put it back

0:20:09.280,0:20:13.360
is i want to determine

0:20:11.280,0:20:14.720
if i'm on the ground or not because if

0:20:13.360,0:20:17.200
i'm on the ground

0:20:14.720,0:20:18.880
then i can do things like jump if i'm

0:20:17.200,0:20:20.880
not on the ground then i need to

0:20:18.880,0:20:22.240
to do this code right here which is fall

0:20:20.880,0:20:25.679
so i'm going to actually grab

0:20:22.240,0:20:26.159
an if else statement uh and stick it in

0:20:25.679,0:20:28.720
here

0:20:26.159,0:20:30.320
so mckinley was like throwing her hand

0:20:28.720,0:20:30.799
up she wanted to say what we needed for

0:20:30.320,0:20:32.400
this

0:20:30.799,0:20:33.840
and so i want to have an if else

0:20:32.400,0:20:36.640
statement

0:20:33.840,0:20:37.840
and so now i've got to put in here a

0:20:36.640,0:20:39.600
question

0:20:37.840,0:20:41.520
that'll determine if i'm on the ground

0:20:39.600,0:20:42.159
or not right so i just want to ask some

0:20:41.520,0:20:44.240
question

0:20:42.159,0:20:46.000
that says hey am i on the ground and the

0:20:44.240,0:20:50.240
question that i want to ask is

0:20:46.000,0:20:52.240
is my y value equal to that ground value

0:20:50.240,0:20:54.000
so if i want to test if things are equal

0:20:52.240,0:20:57.280
that's in operators

0:20:54.000,0:21:00.400
so i need to grab the equals operator

0:20:57.280,0:21:04.080
and i want to check to see is my

0:21:00.400,0:21:07.039
y position equal to

0:21:04.080,0:21:08.400
that variable called ground level you

0:21:07.039,0:21:11.200
can see how we use that variable called

0:21:08.400,0:21:12.000
ground level a few times in our code so

0:21:11.200,0:21:14.159
if the y

0:21:12.000,0:21:15.200
position is equal to ground level so if

0:21:14.159,0:21:18.320
they are equal

0:21:15.200,0:21:20.559
this top area means i'm on the ground if

0:21:18.320,0:21:22.640
i'm on the ground i don't fall

0:21:20.559,0:21:24.640
so this code right here goes into the

0:21:22.640,0:21:26.080
bottom

0:21:24.640,0:21:27.679
so it goes into the bottom because if

0:21:26.080,0:21:29.760
i'm not on the ground

0:21:27.679,0:21:31.520
then i want to fall right so let's go

0:21:29.760,0:21:34.080
ahead and run our code again

0:21:31.520,0:21:34.880
and he should fall up until he hits the

0:21:34.080,0:21:37.760
ground and then

0:21:34.880,0:21:39.200
and then he stops if you wanted to uh

0:21:37.760,0:21:41.280
you could also add

0:21:39.200,0:21:44.240
um when you're on the ground you could

0:21:41.280,0:21:45.919
say set full speed to zero so

0:21:44.240,0:21:48.320
this will mean that when you're on the

0:21:45.919,0:21:49.039
ground you're no longer falling so it's

0:21:48.320,0:21:50.400
zero

0:21:49.039,0:21:52.400
so this would make it even better so now

0:21:50.400,0:21:54.400
he falls and then when he hits the

0:21:52.400,0:21:56.240
ground he stops

0:21:54.400,0:21:57.520
and this actually is very true to

0:21:56.240,0:21:58.000
physics because you hit the ground and

0:21:57.520,0:22:00.080
you're going

0:21:58.000,0:22:01.520
really fast and then you just

0:22:00.080,0:22:04.559
immediately come to a stop

0:22:01.520,0:22:06.799
right which can hurt but you can see

0:22:04.559,0:22:08.559
this really simulates physics

0:22:06.799,0:22:10.320
now the next thing we want to do is i

0:22:08.559,0:22:12.240
want to be able to uh

0:22:10.320,0:22:14.080
to jump right so like i want to be able

0:22:12.240,0:22:16.880
to press the space bar

0:22:14.080,0:22:18.080
to jump right now i don't have any way

0:22:16.880,0:22:21.120
to jump right

0:22:18.080,0:22:22.559
so what i want to do is inside this area

0:22:21.120,0:22:24.320
here and this is always tricky when

0:22:22.559,0:22:26.080
you're putting code in a certain spot

0:22:24.320,0:22:28.080
inside this area here which means i'm on

0:22:26.080,0:22:28.880
the ground i want to check for the space

0:22:28.080,0:22:30.960
bar

0:22:28.880,0:22:33.440
so i've got to go grab an if statement

0:22:30.960,0:22:35.120
so control if

0:22:33.440,0:22:36.640
for better for worse scratch makes this

0:22:35.120,0:22:37.520
sometimes tricky but i want to drop it

0:22:36.640,0:22:40.080
right here

0:22:37.520,0:22:42.000
right so it's after the fall speed not

0:22:40.080,0:22:45.520
not inside of it which would be there

0:22:42.000,0:22:47.679
i want to put it right after and in here

0:22:45.520,0:22:49.280
so i'm on the ground my fall speed is

0:22:47.679,0:22:52.400
currently zero

0:22:49.280,0:22:55.600
i want to check for the space bar

0:22:52.400,0:22:58.000
so i want to find key pressed uh space

0:22:55.600,0:23:00.159
the default was was right for once

0:22:58.000,0:23:02.480
and if that happens then i want to jump

0:23:00.159,0:23:05.120
right so how how do i jump

0:23:02.480,0:23:05.760
really all jumping is in this game is

0:23:05.120,0:23:08.159
jump is

0:23:05.760,0:23:10.480
is making your fall speed be a positive

0:23:08.159,0:23:11.360
number and then that way your fall speed

0:23:10.480,0:23:13.600
is going up

0:23:11.360,0:23:16.240
so what we're going to do to jump is

0:23:13.600,0:23:19.440
we're going to set the fall speed

0:23:16.240,0:23:21.440
to some positive number i don't really

0:23:19.440,0:23:23.600
know the right positive number

0:23:21.440,0:23:24.480
but this number determines how high you

0:23:23.600,0:23:26.880
jump

0:23:24.480,0:23:28.640
i'm going to start off with 20. if 20

0:23:26.880,0:23:30.720
turns out to be a really short jump

0:23:28.640,0:23:32.000
then i'll make it bigger if 20 turns out

0:23:30.720,0:23:33.360
to like jump me off the top of the

0:23:32.000,0:23:37.120
screen then i'll make it smaller

0:23:33.360,0:23:39.440
right and in jumping we have to uh

0:23:37.120,0:23:40.720
do the very first start of the jump so

0:23:39.440,0:23:43.520
we're going to

0:23:40.720,0:23:43.520
change y

0:23:43.760,0:23:47.760
by the fall speed

0:23:47.919,0:23:50.960
and what this does is this will get you

0:23:50.159,0:23:52.559
off the ground

0:23:50.960,0:23:54.400
so in our code it's important that we

0:23:52.559,0:23:56.320
get ourselves off the ground so this is

0:23:54.400,0:23:58.080
the first part of your jump so you

0:23:56.320,0:23:59.840
you're rearing back and you say my full

0:23:58.080,0:24:00.480
speed is 20 and so we're going to move

0:23:59.840,0:24:02.960
you up

0:24:00.480,0:24:05.200
those 20 pixels and then after you're

0:24:02.960,0:24:06.559
off the ground then falling should start

0:24:05.200,0:24:08.159
taking effect

0:24:06.559,0:24:10.080
so there's a lot of complexities in the

0:24:08.159,0:24:13.039
code here but if it all works

0:24:10.080,0:24:13.919
um you should be able to uh perceive

0:24:13.039,0:24:16.640
jumping

0:24:13.919,0:24:18.159
so there i jumped and you can see how it

0:24:16.640,0:24:21.600
feels like a jump

0:24:18.159,0:24:23.840
because you start fast and then you go

0:24:21.600,0:24:24.960
so slow at the top to the point where

0:24:23.840,0:24:26.480
you actually stop

0:24:24.960,0:24:28.559
for one moment at the very top of the

0:24:26.480,0:24:30.240
jump and then you come back down

0:24:28.559,0:24:32.960
and it actually turns out that 20 was a

0:24:30.240,0:24:34.960
really good guess so 20

0:24:32.960,0:24:36.880
makes me jump uh not quite off the

0:24:34.960,0:24:38.480
screen but pretty high

0:24:36.880,0:24:40.640
if you want to tweak it a little bit so

0:24:38.480,0:24:42.000
you jump a little higher that's fine

0:24:40.640,0:24:43.840
if you don't like jumping this high you

0:24:42.000,0:24:46.640
can jump a little lower but i think i'm

0:24:43.840,0:24:48.320
pretty happy with 20.

0:24:46.640,0:24:49.679
another thing that i'm going to do is

0:24:48.320,0:24:51.440
now that i can jump

0:24:49.679,0:24:54.080
i don't need to do this initial fall

0:24:51.440,0:24:56.080
anymore so i'm actually going to start

0:24:54.080,0:24:59.200
at

0:24:56.080,0:25:00.000
my y of ground level so i'm just

0:24:59.200,0:25:02.720
choosing to start

0:25:00.000,0:25:04.320
my game just right on the ground no no

0:25:02.720,0:25:06.080
no initial fall

0:25:04.320,0:25:09.919
just because i can now jump so there's

0:25:06.080,0:25:09.919
no reason to start off up in the air

0:25:10.320,0:25:14.480
cool i haven't saved my game yet it

0:25:12.640,0:25:15.600
seems like a really good time to save my

0:25:14.480,0:25:20.000
game

0:25:15.600,0:25:22.480
i'm going to call mine cactus jump

0:25:20.000,0:25:23.919
you can call yours whatever you want i

0:25:22.480,0:25:26.320
think the solution

0:25:23.919,0:25:27.919
which which i did with bob it's called

0:25:26.320,0:25:29.039
dyno jump because we were jumping over

0:25:27.919,0:25:30.960
dinosaurs

0:25:29.039,0:25:34.080
um but this time i'm jumping over a

0:25:30.960,0:25:35.520
cactus uh so i'll do that

0:25:34.080,0:25:37.840
you can see that the next thing that his

0:25:35.520,0:25:38.400
game does is he's got these dinosaurs

0:25:37.840,0:25:40.880
right

0:25:38.400,0:25:43.520
um and these dinosaurs are coming up a

0:25:40.880,0:25:46.240
cat all the time

0:25:43.520,0:25:48.960
and they obviously score points so you

0:25:46.240,0:25:50.320
can see my score is four right now

0:25:48.960,0:25:53.200
and they score points whenever you

0:25:50.320,0:25:56.080
successfully get a dinosaur to the edge

0:25:53.200,0:25:57.440
and then the game ends when you run into

0:25:56.080,0:25:59.760
the dinosaur right

0:25:57.440,0:26:01.520
with some loud sound effects so that's

0:25:59.760,0:26:04.559
what we're trying to do next

0:26:01.520,0:26:07.760
so you can see the first thing is

0:26:04.559,0:26:08.720
there's many dinosaurs but if we go into

0:26:07.760,0:26:10.720
bob's code

0:26:08.720,0:26:12.240
by the way you can go into people's code

0:26:10.720,0:26:13.440
you can see that there is in fact only

0:26:12.240,0:26:15.760
one dinosaur so

0:26:13.440,0:26:17.200
we're clearly using clones right that's

0:26:15.760,0:26:18.640
the only way you could have multiple

0:26:17.200,0:26:20.799
sprites on the screen

0:26:18.640,0:26:21.760
and only one dinosaur so this concept of

0:26:20.799,0:26:25.120
cloning

0:26:21.760,0:26:26.640
we're going to use it again so

0:26:25.120,0:26:29.679
similar to what we did last time with

0:26:26.640,0:26:32.320
cloning i'm going to clone the cactus

0:26:29.679,0:26:33.600
in my case so the cactus is going to

0:26:32.320,0:26:38.000
have

0:26:33.600,0:26:39.760
a when i start as clone

0:26:38.000,0:26:41.600
um and if you remember what we did last

0:26:39.760,0:26:43.440
time is the original

0:26:41.600,0:26:45.039
we actually are going to eventually hide

0:26:43.440,0:26:46.559
the original

0:26:45.039,0:26:48.880
and so the first thing that you do in a

0:26:46.559,0:26:52.080
clone is you

0:26:48.880,0:26:54.320
show it sometimes you can set

0:26:52.080,0:26:55.520
its x before you show it but in general

0:26:54.320,0:26:57.120
that's something that's going to have to

0:26:55.520,0:26:59.360
happen

0:26:57.120,0:27:01.919
speaking of setting its x and y where

0:26:59.360,0:27:04.559
should the cactus start at right

0:27:01.919,0:27:06.480
it should probably start as far as you

0:27:04.559,0:27:09.039
can get it over on the right side

0:27:06.480,0:27:10.240
so take your your cactus or whatever

0:27:09.039,0:27:12.799
your thing is

0:27:10.240,0:27:14.720
and make sure it's at ground level and

0:27:12.799,0:27:15.679
start it as far to the right as you can

0:27:14.720,0:27:16.720
get it so you can just kind of like

0:27:15.679,0:27:20.000
scoot it over

0:27:16.720,0:27:22.480
until it's like barely even showing that

0:27:20.000,0:27:24.799
is where i want each clone to start so

0:27:22.480,0:27:28.320
i'm going to go into motion

0:27:24.799,0:27:29.840
and i'm going to select go to xy

0:27:28.320,0:27:31.679
i'm going to choose to put it just

0:27:29.840,0:27:33.600
before my show

0:27:31.679,0:27:35.360
that way there's really no risk of like

0:27:33.600,0:27:36.799
seeing the cactus in multiple positions

0:27:35.360,0:27:38.399
so i'm just going to put it before my

0:27:36.799,0:27:40.159
show

0:27:38.399,0:27:42.960
and then what my cactus is going to do

0:27:40.159,0:27:44.640
is he's going to move across the screen

0:27:42.960,0:27:48.000
so to move across the screen we're going

0:27:44.640,0:27:49.600
to have to do some things forever

0:27:48.000,0:27:52.240
and to move across the screen i'm going

0:27:49.600,0:27:54.480
to go to motion

0:27:52.240,0:27:56.399
i'm going to go ahead and use change x

0:27:54.480,0:27:58.720
by

0:27:56.399,0:28:00.880
and so i'm going to change x by negative

0:27:58.720,0:28:03.039
3.

0:28:00.880,0:28:04.559
and so my goal here is to to see if i

0:28:03.039,0:28:06.000
can get this working

0:28:04.559,0:28:08.799
and then once i can see if i can get it

0:28:06.000,0:28:10.480
working then i'll make it better

0:28:08.799,0:28:13.039
so right now i have when i start as

0:28:10.480,0:28:15.520
clone go to that position

0:28:13.039,0:28:16.559
show myself uh and then start moving

0:28:15.520,0:28:18.960
across the screen

0:28:16.559,0:28:20.559
there's going to be more code but that's

0:28:18.960,0:28:22.240
enough to get us started

0:28:20.559,0:28:24.159
if we were to run the game right now

0:28:22.240,0:28:26.720
though nothing would happen

0:28:24.159,0:28:28.320
because we we didn't make any clones yet

0:28:26.720,0:28:29.679
right so nothing happens because we

0:28:28.320,0:28:31.919
haven't made a clone

0:28:29.679,0:28:33.200
so the question is who makes the clones

0:28:31.919,0:28:35.760
right so somebody's got to make the

0:28:33.200,0:28:37.919
clones and put them on the screen

0:28:35.760,0:28:39.120
many people can make the clones mckinley

0:28:37.919,0:28:41.279
who do you think should make them

0:28:39.120,0:28:42.559
the stage yeah i like to have the stage

0:28:41.279,0:28:44.640
make them so i'm going to actually go

0:28:42.559,0:28:46.640
over to the stage

0:28:44.640,0:28:48.080
and i like to have him create the clones

0:28:46.640,0:28:48.480
and kind of like put things out into the

0:28:48.080,0:28:50.640
world

0:28:48.480,0:28:53.520
it just feels like a good job for him

0:28:50.640,0:28:55.440
mckimley you got a plan

0:28:53.520,0:28:57.039
oh one of the stages of her sorry i

0:28:55.440,0:28:58.960
should say

0:28:57.039,0:29:00.159
then she can start as many clones as you

0:28:58.960,0:29:02.240
want thank you for cleaving me

0:29:00.159,0:29:05.360
politically correct this

0:29:02.240,0:29:07.200
all right she's a stinker so the stage

0:29:05.360,0:29:08.880
is going to have a wind green flag

0:29:07.200,0:29:12.720
clicked

0:29:08.880,0:29:16.559
and it's going to have a forever

0:29:12.720,0:29:18.080
and then it's going to um create a clone

0:29:16.559,0:29:19.600
and then wait

0:29:18.080,0:29:21.120
or wait and then create a clone it

0:29:19.600,0:29:23.039
doesn't really matter what you do

0:29:21.120,0:29:24.159
i'm going to wait and then create a

0:29:23.039,0:29:26.720
clone

0:29:24.159,0:29:27.679
maybe i'll crank out a dinosaur every

0:29:26.720,0:29:31.200
two seconds

0:29:27.679,0:29:32.080
or sorry a cactus so when the green flag

0:29:31.200,0:29:34.000
is clicked

0:29:32.080,0:29:35.840
i'm going to forever wait for two

0:29:34.000,0:29:37.600
seconds and then create a dinosaur

0:29:35.840,0:29:38.720
i guess you could do it in either order

0:29:37.600,0:29:40.080
it's just a matter of whether you want a

0:29:38.720,0:29:40.960
second when your game starts or whether

0:29:40.080,0:29:44.080
you want to just go

0:29:40.960,0:29:46.480
right so either is fine so if i hit the

0:29:44.080,0:29:48.000
stop and then the play button now i

0:29:46.480,0:29:50.159
should hopefully have uh

0:29:48.000,0:29:52.640
oh i said dinosaur didn't even say

0:29:50.159,0:29:56.240
dinosaur i meant to say cactus

0:29:52.640,0:29:57.760
i was creating clones of my my dinosaur

0:29:56.240,0:29:59.919
which were all right on top of one

0:29:57.760,0:30:01.919
another which was not what i wanted

0:29:59.919,0:30:03.120
um so there you can see that my cactus

0:30:01.919,0:30:06.159
are now coming out

0:30:03.120,0:30:07.600
uh every two seconds right now i can

0:30:06.159,0:30:09.600
blow right through them

0:30:07.600,0:30:11.679
but this is a good time to check to see

0:30:09.600,0:30:13.679
if your game is too hard

0:30:11.679,0:30:14.880
personally i consider this a little too

0:30:13.679,0:30:17.919
hard

0:30:14.880,0:30:21.679
so i'm going to change my game some

0:30:17.919,0:30:21.679
i'm going to make it 4 seconds

0:30:21.760,0:30:24.720
now there's a couple things that we

0:30:22.960,0:30:25.679
still need to fix so i think my game got

0:30:24.720,0:30:28.559
a lot easier

0:30:25.679,0:30:29.120
uh which is good um but i think that my

0:30:28.559,0:30:31.360
game is

0:30:29.120,0:30:34.960
is just a little boring right so the

0:30:31.360,0:30:37.679
cactus come out at exactly the same time

0:30:34.960,0:30:39.200
they run at exactly the same speed um

0:30:37.679,0:30:40.480
there's a good chance that i could play

0:30:39.200,0:30:42.720
this game forever

0:30:40.480,0:30:44.240
um and so i know i'm not actually

0:30:42.720,0:30:45.279
hitting me up but i'm pretending like i

0:30:44.240,0:30:47.840
would be hitting them

0:30:45.279,0:30:49.200
so i want to make my game more fun uh

0:30:47.840,0:30:50.960
and so as the software design

0:30:49.200,0:30:53.120
developer it's up to you to make a game

0:30:50.960,0:30:54.480
fun now people are always tempted to

0:30:53.120,0:30:56.240
make their game impossible

0:30:54.480,0:30:58.080
right like shoot them out as fast as you

0:30:56.240,0:31:00.480
can turns out that's not fun

0:30:58.080,0:31:01.120
um or they make it too easy that's not

0:31:00.480,0:31:02.640
fun either

0:31:01.120,0:31:05.440
you've got to pick the right amount of

0:31:02.640,0:31:07.440
hard so to make my game more fun i'm

0:31:05.440,0:31:09.279
going to introduce some randomness

0:31:07.440,0:31:10.559
so instead of making them every four

0:31:09.279,0:31:12.960
seconds

0:31:10.559,0:31:13.840
i'm gonna pick a random number to where

0:31:12.960,0:31:16.559
it's like

0:31:13.840,0:31:18.000
two to five seconds right or maybe two

0:31:16.559,0:31:19.519
to four is plenty

0:31:18.000,0:31:21.360
that way they're going to come out at

0:31:19.519,0:31:24.080
different intervals so you never really

0:31:21.360,0:31:26.000
know how often to expect them

0:31:24.080,0:31:27.279
and their speed instead of making it

0:31:26.000,0:31:30.240
always be three

0:31:27.279,0:31:31.279
i'm going to make it variable as well

0:31:30.240,0:31:32.720
now you can't

0:31:31.279,0:31:34.000
what you want to do is you i know you

0:31:32.720,0:31:35.360
want to put this right there but don't

0:31:34.000,0:31:37.440
do that because that would mean

0:31:35.360,0:31:39.519
that like he just changes the speed all

0:31:37.440,0:31:41.039
the time we want to make a variable for

0:31:39.519,0:31:42.399
him so that you can set it once and then

0:31:41.039,0:31:47.600
he'll always be that speed

0:31:42.399,0:31:49.760
so go to variables uh make a variable

0:31:47.600,0:31:51.600
this time we definitely want to check

0:31:49.760,0:31:53.519
for this sprite only

0:31:51.600,0:31:55.279
this is important because then each

0:31:53.519,0:31:58.640
clone can have its own speed

0:31:55.279,0:31:58.640
and i'm just going to call it speed

0:31:58.840,0:32:04.399
speed so for this sprite only speed and

0:32:02.640,0:32:07.440
this is on my cactus this is the thing

0:32:04.399,0:32:11.039
that's being jumped over

0:32:07.440,0:32:13.039
and i'm going to set speed

0:32:11.039,0:32:14.240
at the top make sure you get the right

0:32:13.039,0:32:14.720
variable because like i don't want to

0:32:14.240,0:32:17.279
change

0:32:14.720,0:32:19.039
full speed that's not my job here um and

0:32:17.279,0:32:22.960
i'm going to set it to

0:32:19.039,0:32:24.240
some random value so you can see before

0:32:22.960,0:32:27.039
it was negative 3

0:32:24.240,0:32:28.399
um so i'll go from i don't know maybe

0:32:27.039,0:32:30.640
negative five

0:32:28.399,0:32:32.000
to negative two i don't know it just

0:32:30.640,0:32:33.440
depends on what's fun maybe i'll go in

0:32:32.000,0:32:34.399
even bigger range negative six to

0:32:33.440,0:32:35.840
negative two so

0:32:34.399,0:32:37.840
some of them are gonna shoot out like

0:32:35.840,0:32:38.880
fireballs and then others are gonna be

0:32:37.840,0:32:40.480
pokey

0:32:38.880,0:32:42.399
and they might even like overlap in

0:32:40.480,0:32:45.600
crazy ways so

0:32:42.399,0:32:48.240
i created this variable called speed

0:32:45.600,0:32:49.279
i set it to a random number now i need

0:32:48.240,0:32:52.320
to use it

0:32:49.279,0:32:54.880
so i'm going to use speed right

0:32:52.320,0:32:56.000
inside here and notice that it's

0:32:54.880,0:32:58.480
negative so it's going to move

0:32:56.000,0:33:01.919
to the left i don't need to show it up

0:32:58.480,0:33:04.159
here so i'm going to uncheck this box

0:33:01.919,0:33:05.840
and now i can see if my game is actually

0:33:04.159,0:33:08.000
fun and playable

0:33:05.840,0:33:09.039
again i can't die in it but that's okay

0:33:08.000,0:33:10.640
it's a good way

0:33:09.039,0:33:12.320
to kind of learn things so you can see

0:33:10.640,0:33:14.960
that that guy came out uh

0:33:12.320,0:33:16.480
slow and pokey um and so i had two

0:33:14.960,0:33:18.720
really slow and pokey

0:33:16.480,0:33:20.080
that was actually kind of impossible uh

0:33:18.720,0:33:23.279
but that's okay

0:33:20.080,0:33:24.000
um i think that for me uh the game might

0:33:23.279,0:33:25.840
be fun right

0:33:24.000,0:33:27.200
now so occasionally there's things that

0:33:25.840,0:33:28.720
happen that make it really hard so

0:33:27.200,0:33:30.640
there's a slow one

0:33:28.720,0:33:33.440
um oh and then there's a fast one right

0:33:30.640,0:33:36.240
after i think for me that's a good

0:33:33.440,0:33:38.159
um level of difficulty you can play

0:33:36.240,0:33:39.440
yours and you can decide what is what is

0:33:38.159,0:33:41.360
appropriate for you

0:33:39.440,0:33:42.559
right is it too easy is it too hard

0:33:41.360,0:33:42.960
because you don't want to play for an

0:33:42.559,0:33:45.120
hour

0:33:42.960,0:33:46.880
right but you also want to have a chance

0:33:45.120,0:33:48.880
uh there i had to do a double jump

0:33:46.880,0:33:50.559
all right i think mine's good um all

0:33:48.880,0:33:51.039
right so what we need to do next let's

0:33:50.559,0:33:52.080
hide

0:33:51.039,0:33:53.600
you can see how there's like a little

0:33:52.080,0:33:54.720
cactus hanging over here that's the

0:33:53.600,0:33:56.640
original right

0:33:54.720,0:33:58.960
so whenever you use clones like this

0:33:56.640,0:34:00.799
it's very common to hide the original

0:33:58.960,0:34:03.519
um and so you can see that now there's

0:34:00.799,0:34:04.799
no like little cactus over there

0:34:03.519,0:34:06.799
all right i think the next thing i want

0:34:04.799,0:34:08.320
to do is i want to

0:34:06.799,0:34:11.359
make it to where if i actually hit a

0:34:08.320,0:34:13.119
cactus something bad happens

0:34:11.359,0:34:15.119
or whenever it gets over here something

0:34:13.119,0:34:17.040
good happens either one

0:34:15.119,0:34:18.320
could be implemented next and that's

0:34:17.040,0:34:21.119
code that's going to happen

0:34:18.320,0:34:21.919
inside the cactus so inside the cactus

0:34:21.119,0:34:25.359
we really need

0:34:21.919,0:34:27.119
two if statements so we're going to say

0:34:25.359,0:34:29.119
i'm in in my cactus the thing that's

0:34:27.119,0:34:31.839
getting jumped over i'm going to add two

0:34:29.119,0:34:31.839
if statements

0:34:32.000,0:34:35.119
because i want to check to see if i made

0:34:33.599,0:34:38.960
it to the edge um

0:34:35.119,0:34:40.879
or if i've hit the the hero right

0:34:38.960,0:34:42.159
so let's go ahead and do the edge first

0:34:40.879,0:34:45.440
it doesn't really matter

0:34:42.159,0:34:49.839
so the edge we're going to see if our x

0:34:45.440,0:34:51.280
value has gotten less than some number

0:34:49.839,0:34:54.320
so if you remember the screen it goes

0:34:51.280,0:34:58.000
from positive 180 to negative 180

0:34:54.320,0:35:01.119
and so if my x value gets below like

0:34:58.000,0:35:04.880
somewhere over here i'm going to say

0:35:01.119,0:35:06.800
negative i don't know 160.

0:35:04.880,0:35:07.920
i don't want to do 180 because because

0:35:06.800,0:35:10.079
you can see how

0:35:07.920,0:35:11.680
the cactus don't quite get to the very

0:35:10.079,0:35:13.760
edge they actually like

0:35:11.680,0:35:15.280
stop before they get too far so you

0:35:13.760,0:35:17.440
could play with it

0:35:15.280,0:35:19.839
but i think that 160 is probably going

0:35:17.440,0:35:22.800
to be safe enough once they're past 160

0:35:19.839,0:35:23.280
it's safe to delete them right so i want

0:35:22.800,0:35:26.880
to see

0:35:23.280,0:35:27.680
if their x value so the x value is in

0:35:26.880,0:35:31.040
motion

0:35:27.680,0:35:33.599
x position so if the cactus

0:35:31.040,0:35:34.400
x position is ever less than negative

0:35:33.599,0:35:35.920
160

0:35:34.400,0:35:37.440
it means it's gotten all the way to the

0:35:35.920,0:35:39.920
left then i want to

0:35:37.440,0:35:40.480
score points and i want to play a little

0:35:39.920,0:35:43.200
sound

0:35:40.480,0:35:44.000
just to let them know they did good uh

0:35:43.200,0:35:46.240
the order doesn't

0:35:44.000,0:35:48.640
matter um i'm going to play a sound

0:35:46.240,0:35:50.400
first the sound that i want to play

0:35:48.640,0:35:52.720
i'm going to have to add a sound called

0:35:50.400,0:35:52.720
coin

0:35:54.480,0:35:58.480
and so i've now added the sound coin to

0:35:56.560,0:35:59.280
my sound library now i can use it in my

0:35:58.480,0:36:01.440
code

0:35:59.280,0:36:02.560
so i'm just going to say start sound

0:36:01.440,0:36:05.599
coin

0:36:02.560,0:36:07.200
sometimes you want to start sound or

0:36:05.599,0:36:09.680
play sound until done

0:36:07.200,0:36:11.280
other times you just want to start it i

0:36:09.680,0:36:12.000
don't think it matters this time i'll

0:36:11.280,0:36:14.400
tell you what we'll

0:36:12.000,0:36:15.520
switch it to play until done that'll

0:36:14.400,0:36:16.640
actually be better because i'm going to

0:36:15.520,0:36:18.720
delete it

0:36:16.640,0:36:20.240
as soon as the sound finishes so this

0:36:18.720,0:36:21.040
will help me make sure that the sound

0:36:20.240,0:36:23.920
finishes

0:36:21.040,0:36:24.480
so i did switch it to play sound coin

0:36:23.920,0:36:27.040
until

0:36:24.480,0:36:28.800
done and then as soon as it's done i

0:36:27.040,0:36:31.520
want to score a point

0:36:28.800,0:36:34.480
so i go to variables i'm going to have

0:36:31.520,0:36:36.240
to make a variable called score

0:36:34.480,0:36:38.720
this one is going to be visible on the

0:36:36.240,0:36:40.320
screen and so i'm going to make it for

0:36:38.720,0:36:42.160
all sprites

0:36:40.320,0:36:44.000
and i'm going to make it pretty because

0:36:42.160,0:36:45.680
it's going to be visible on the screen

0:36:44.000,0:36:47.440
so that i've got full speed and i've got

0:36:45.680,0:36:49.119
score

0:36:47.440,0:36:50.400
by the way if you don't want full speed

0:36:49.119,0:36:52.560
visible anymore i think we're kind of

0:36:50.400,0:36:54.000
past that you can hide it if you want

0:36:52.560,0:36:56.240
that's that's up to you whichever

0:36:54.000,0:36:58.160
whatever you prefer

0:36:56.240,0:37:00.560
um and so now i've got this variable

0:36:58.160,0:37:02.800
score um i'm going to need to do

0:37:00.560,0:37:04.000
the different tasks with it i need to

0:37:02.800,0:37:06.800
set it to zero

0:37:04.000,0:37:09.200
somewhere and then i need to also

0:37:06.800,0:37:11.119
increment it somewhere

0:37:09.200,0:37:13.440
i'm going to choose to increment it

0:37:11.119,0:37:14.880
right here after i play a coin

0:37:13.440,0:37:17.119
or before i play a coin it doesn't

0:37:14.880,0:37:21.119
matter i'll do it before

0:37:17.119,0:37:23.680
so i'm going to change score by one

0:37:21.119,0:37:24.800
we also need to set the score to zero

0:37:23.680,0:37:26.880
somewhere

0:37:24.800,0:37:27.839
see if you can figure out where would be

0:37:26.880,0:37:29.839
a good place

0:37:27.839,0:37:31.200
to set the score to zero so i'll let you

0:37:29.839,0:37:37.839
see if you can do that on your own see

0:37:31.200,0:37:39.839
if you can find a good place for it

0:37:37.839,0:37:41.760
all right so i had to go uh quiz my

0:37:39.839,0:37:44.160
campers too but the question is um

0:37:41.760,0:37:45.280
where do you want to set score to zero

0:37:44.160,0:37:47.280
when the game starts

0:37:45.280,0:37:48.720
um and it's a trick question because it

0:37:47.280,0:37:51.040
basically the answer is

0:37:48.720,0:37:51.920
anywhere except for here right because

0:37:51.040,0:37:53.760
because here

0:37:51.920,0:37:55.359
is when i start his clone which happens

0:37:53.760,0:37:57.760
all the time you want

0:37:55.359,0:37:59.680
somewhere that happens only one time so

0:37:57.760,0:38:01.760
you can put it on your hero

0:37:59.680,0:38:03.920
where he has a wind green flag clicked

0:38:01.760,0:38:05.760
or you could put it on your stage

0:38:03.920,0:38:08.000
doesn't matter which one you do

0:38:05.760,0:38:09.839
but it cannot be in this code so i need

0:38:08.000,0:38:11.839
to set it to zero

0:38:09.839,0:38:13.200
in one of these places so i'm gonna put

0:38:11.839,0:38:15.200
it on my stage

0:38:13.200,0:38:17.119
but it works just as well on your hero

0:38:15.200,0:38:20.160
sprite so i'm gonna say

0:38:17.119,0:38:22.480
set score to zero all right back to my

0:38:20.160,0:38:26.000
code on the cactus

0:38:22.480,0:38:29.280
all right so i say change score by one

0:38:26.000,0:38:31.440
play the coin sound until done and then

0:38:29.280,0:38:34.720
the last thing i want to do is i want to

0:38:31.440,0:38:37.359
delete this clone so i'm i'm done with

0:38:34.720,0:38:40.640
them right so i can delete this clone

0:38:37.359,0:38:42.480
so i go ahead and hit play and so now

0:38:40.640,0:38:43.920
whenever they get to the edge they

0:38:42.480,0:38:46.000
should disappear

0:38:43.920,0:38:47.040
i can see that 160 was actually a little

0:38:46.000,0:38:48.480
conservative

0:38:47.040,0:38:50.400
um maybe i should have picked that

0:38:48.480,0:38:52.079
better let me just see

0:38:50.400,0:38:54.320
i'm going to make my cactus visible for

0:38:52.079,0:38:57.839
just a minute if i wanted i could

0:38:54.320,0:39:00.880
probably let them go until there

0:38:57.839,0:39:03.440
negative two four two

0:39:00.880,0:39:05.200
oh i know what i did wrong the x goes to

0:39:03.440,0:39:08.320
negative two forty whoops

0:39:05.200,0:39:11.760
so yeah so 160 was just straight ah

0:39:08.320,0:39:14.800
negative 160 was just the wrong number

0:39:11.760,0:39:18.160
um so i should have done like negative

0:39:14.800,0:39:20.400
um 2 um 30.

0:39:18.160,0:39:22.800
negative 230 be good all right so that

0:39:20.400,0:39:24.240
hopefully uh fixes my problem

0:39:22.800,0:39:25.680
um and then of course i showed my

0:39:24.240,0:39:27.200
original again so i've got to get rid of

0:39:25.680,0:39:28.480
my original

0:39:27.200,0:39:31.440
but that that seems like it's working

0:39:28.480,0:39:32.880
pretty well all right my original

0:39:31.440,0:39:34.480
the funny thing is is it doesn't even

0:39:32.880,0:39:36.720
matter where your original is

0:39:34.480,0:39:38.000
i'm going to plant my original up here

0:39:36.720,0:39:39.680
and hide him

0:39:38.000,0:39:42.079
because it doesn't matter where he's at

0:39:39.680,0:39:43.599
because he's hidden anyway

0:39:42.079,0:39:46.160
cool so i think mine is working pretty

0:39:43.599,0:39:49.280
well my coin sound is super loud

0:39:46.160,0:39:50.320
uh but that's fine and so every time it

0:39:49.280,0:39:52.480
gets over there

0:39:50.320,0:39:54.160
you can see it scores a point and it

0:39:52.480,0:39:55.440
plays the coin sound

0:39:54.160,0:39:57.599
now the next thing i want to do is i

0:39:55.440,0:39:59.760
want to make it actually like hit my

0:39:57.599,0:40:01.520
dinosaur

0:39:59.760,0:40:02.880
so i'm going to need to add code to do

0:40:01.520,0:40:06.560
that

0:40:02.880,0:40:07.680
so i'm going to say if i'm hitting my

0:40:06.560,0:40:10.240
dinosaur

0:40:07.680,0:40:10.800
then something happens and the thing i

0:40:10.240,0:40:12.640
want to do

0:40:10.800,0:40:14.560
is i want to go to sensing

0:40:12.640,0:40:17.839
[Music]

0:40:14.560,0:40:19.359
and i want to grab touching and right

0:40:17.839,0:40:21.359
now it says mouse pointer but i want to

0:40:19.359,0:40:24.560
switch that to whatever my hero is

0:40:21.359,0:40:27.440
so touching dinosaur 4.

0:40:24.560,0:40:29.200
now whenever we hit the hero which my

0:40:27.440,0:40:30.720
heroes called dinosaur 4

0:40:29.200,0:40:32.400
i don't like that name i wish i was just

0:40:30.720,0:40:34.319
called dinosaur

0:40:32.400,0:40:35.680
so i could change that so now whenever

0:40:34.319,0:40:37.680
i'm touching the dinosaur

0:40:35.680,0:40:39.839
what do i want to have happen well i

0:40:37.680,0:40:40.640
really just want to broadcast an event

0:40:39.839,0:40:43.359
so i want to tell

0:40:40.640,0:40:44.640
all the rest of the world i just hit the

0:40:43.359,0:40:45.440
dinosaur right so we're just going to

0:40:44.640,0:40:49.920
broadcast

0:40:45.440,0:40:52.880
hit is our plan so that's in events

0:40:49.920,0:40:53.280
and we're going to broadcast the message

0:40:52.880,0:40:56.560
um

0:40:53.280,0:40:57.839
and i'm going to type in hit if you want

0:40:56.560,0:40:58.880
to type in a slightly different name

0:40:57.839,0:41:01.280
that's fine

0:40:58.880,0:41:02.240
but i use hit all the time so we just

0:41:01.280,0:41:06.720
broadcast

0:41:02.240,0:41:09.680
hit and then every single sprite

0:41:06.720,0:41:12.800
is gonna listen for hits the way you

0:41:09.680,0:41:16.160
listen for hit is you say when i receive

0:41:12.800,0:41:16.880
um hit and one of the most common things

0:41:16.160,0:41:19.680
you do is

0:41:16.880,0:41:22.160
you stop all your other scripts so i'm

0:41:19.680,0:41:24.560
going to actually come down to

0:41:22.160,0:41:25.760
it says stop all i find this confusing

0:41:24.560,0:41:28.960
it says stop all

0:41:25.760,0:41:30.560
but you switch it to stop other scripts

0:41:28.960,0:41:34.240
in the sprite

0:41:30.560,0:41:34.880
so whenever there's a hit all the cactus

0:41:34.240,0:41:36.800
clones

0:41:34.880,0:41:38.160
they're gonna all stop their other

0:41:36.800,0:41:39.040
script so stop what you were doing

0:41:38.160,0:41:41.520
before

0:41:39.040,0:41:42.880
these two lines actually need to be in

0:41:41.520,0:41:44.880
everybody's code

0:41:42.880,0:41:47.280
um one way that i like to copy is that

0:41:44.880,0:41:49.520
you can actually just drag and drop it

0:41:47.280,0:41:51.040
so i can drop it there and now over in

0:41:49.520,0:41:54.079
my dinosaur

0:41:51.040,0:41:55.599
there's there's some code in here so he

0:41:54.079,0:41:58.400
has a when i receive hit

0:41:55.599,0:42:00.880
stop other scripts i also want to drag

0:41:58.400,0:42:03.359
and drop it onto the stage

0:42:00.880,0:42:05.040
so if i go into the stages code he also

0:42:03.359,0:42:07.599
has it

0:42:05.040,0:42:09.359
and this is pretty common uh way to use

0:42:07.599,0:42:10.240
events so whenever somebody broadcasts

0:42:09.359,0:42:12.000
this event

0:42:10.240,0:42:13.440
everybody stops what they were doing

0:42:12.000,0:42:16.079
before

0:42:13.440,0:42:18.000
including the cactus including the stage

0:42:16.079,0:42:20.560
including the dinosaur

0:42:18.000,0:42:22.400
and then it is the end of the game so

0:42:20.560,0:42:25.200
it'd be good to

0:42:22.400,0:42:27.280
play some sound to let them know that

0:42:25.200,0:42:30.319
the game is over

0:42:27.280,0:42:31.680
so let's go to sound actually i'll

0:42:30.319,0:42:33.040
probably have to add a sound

0:42:31.680,0:42:35.520
so you're going to have to add some

0:42:33.040,0:42:38.400
sound i don't care what sound you add

0:42:35.520,0:42:41.760
i'm going to go see what dr bob added he

0:42:38.400,0:42:44.960
added oops so i'm going to add a sound

0:42:41.760,0:42:46.640
called oops

0:42:44.960,0:42:48.400
i didn't search for it very well i guess

0:42:46.640,0:42:51.280
i'll have to manually search for it

0:42:48.400,0:42:53.599
oops is right here if you want to put in

0:42:51.280,0:42:57.839
a different sound that's fine

0:42:53.599,0:42:59.680
but i'm going to play oops until done

0:42:57.839,0:43:04.079
and then i'm going to

0:42:59.680,0:43:07.839
stop all so if this works

0:43:04.079,0:43:11.119
my game should be complete so i'm now

0:43:07.839,0:43:12.160
able to jump over a cactus and score

0:43:11.119,0:43:14.000
points

0:43:12.160,0:43:16.560
but if i run into a cactus i'm going to

0:43:14.000,0:43:18.960
run into the next one

0:43:16.560,0:43:19.839
it does the oops and then it ends the

0:43:18.960,0:43:22.720
game

0:43:19.839,0:43:24.079
so i'm actually done with my game which

0:43:22.720,0:43:26.079
is cool

0:43:24.079,0:43:27.200
when i finish a game uh what i like to

0:43:26.079,0:43:30.720
do is i like to click on

0:43:27.200,0:43:34.560
share and that makes my public page

0:43:30.720,0:43:38.319
and i'll say use the arrow keys

0:43:34.560,0:43:38.319
to move left and right

0:43:38.800,0:43:43.920
and then i'll say use spacebar uh to

0:43:42.319,0:43:45.839
jump

0:43:43.920,0:43:47.119
and i like to put in some instructions

0:43:45.839,0:43:49.040
uh for my users

0:43:47.119,0:43:51.359
and now i've got this url that i can

0:43:49.040,0:43:53.680
send to friends and family

0:43:51.359,0:43:55.920
all right so i think my game is done um

0:43:53.680,0:43:57.200
i will probably play it one more time

0:43:55.920,0:43:58.880
just kind of like make sure that things

0:43:57.200,0:44:00.800
are good and then i'm going to help my

0:43:58.880,0:44:03.599
campers finish

0:44:00.800,0:44:05.839
and then i'm going to show on a video uh

0:44:03.599,0:44:07.839
what it looks like

0:44:05.839,0:44:09.760
hopefully yours is coming together all

0:44:07.839,0:44:11.839
right campers let's see how you did

0:44:09.760,0:44:13.119
all right mr keegan you're up first what

0:44:11.839,0:44:15.760
have you got for your game today

0:44:13.119,0:44:17.119
uh dogs and vacuum cleaners a dog and a

0:44:15.760,0:44:19.280
vacuum cleaner

0:44:17.119,0:44:22.800
all right let's see your dog let's see

0:44:19.280,0:44:24.720
you get over a vacuum cleaner cool

0:44:22.800,0:44:27.200
what inspired you oh that's a tricky one

0:44:24.720,0:44:29.200
jump them both nice

0:44:27.200,0:44:31.520
what inspired you to do dogs and vacuum

0:44:29.200,0:44:34.720
cleaners

0:44:31.520,0:44:36.560
looks great bud um i didn't hear a sound

0:44:34.720,0:44:39.359
when you lo oh no that was your

0:44:36.560,0:44:41.200
sound wasn't it all right mckinley let's

0:44:39.359,0:44:43.680
see what you've got today

0:44:41.200,0:44:45.760
so this one's mine i modified it so i

0:44:43.680,0:44:46.079
don't press space to jump i press the up

0:44:45.760,0:44:48.319
key

0:44:46.079,0:44:50.400
so that my fingers can just be over here

0:44:48.319,0:44:52.720
so you've got a hummingbird

0:44:50.400,0:44:53.920
uh jumping over snake enemies which is

0:44:52.720,0:44:56.319
cool

0:44:53.920,0:44:58.000
and then yours is set with the uh the

0:44:56.319,0:45:04.079
release interval oh man this is probably

0:44:58.000,0:45:05.920
gonna be a tricky one

0:45:04.079,0:45:07.599
job did you guys enjoy the uh the game

0:45:05.920,0:45:09.359
today yes

0:45:07.599,0:45:11.280
do you enjoy the no internet game as

0:45:09.359,0:45:13.520
well yeah

0:45:11.280,0:45:14.880
cool nicely done uh all right so the

0:45:13.520,0:45:15.599
things i kind of wanted to say at the

0:45:14.880,0:45:17.119
end uh

0:45:15.599,0:45:19.680
that the main message of this camp is

0:45:17.119,0:45:21.119
coding is fun and you can do this right

0:45:19.680,0:45:21.920
it takes a little bit of time it takes

0:45:21.119,0:45:23.680
practice

0:45:21.920,0:45:26.000
the more time you put into it the better

0:45:23.680,0:45:27.760
you get it we also kind of learned again

0:45:26.000,0:45:28.720
you can use cool math skills to do

0:45:27.760,0:45:30.880
things

0:45:28.720,0:45:32.160
this time it was gravity and how to make

0:45:30.880,0:45:33.359
things look like they're falling

0:45:32.160,0:45:35.839
appropriately

0:45:33.359,0:45:36.480
we also learned how to create uh clones

0:45:35.839,0:45:38.400
again

0:45:36.480,0:45:40.960
we have one sprite but actually many of

0:45:38.400,0:45:42.480
them and how broadcasting events can be

0:45:40.960,0:45:44.240
used to communicate

0:45:42.480,0:45:52.640
thanks for joining us we look forward to

0:45:44.240,0:45:52.640
seeing you again tomorrow bye
