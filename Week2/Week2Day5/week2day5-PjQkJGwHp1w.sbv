0:00:04.640,0:00:07.440
hey hey welcome back you made it it is

0:00:07.040,0:00:10.240
day

0:00:07.440,0:00:10.719
five it is the final day of the final

0:00:10.240,0:00:12.480
week

0:00:10.719,0:00:13.759
uh of the coding camp uh you should

0:00:12.480,0:00:15.360
really pat yourself in the back just for

0:00:13.759,0:00:18.480
getting this far honestly there's a

0:00:15.360,0:00:19.039
big drop off in the camp and we lose

0:00:18.480,0:00:21.439
people

0:00:19.039,0:00:23.920
as it goes uh so i'm back here again

0:00:21.439,0:00:25.039
today and no surprise with my campers

0:00:23.920,0:00:27.039
i'll go and let them introduce

0:00:25.039,0:00:28.800
themselves so i'm here with my campers

0:00:27.039,0:00:29.439
again today oh what nice looking shirts

0:00:28.800,0:00:32.399
you have

0:00:29.439,0:00:32.960
it's the connecting with code 2021

0:00:32.399,0:00:34.480
orange

0:00:32.960,0:00:36.399
very nice all right go ahead and

0:00:34.480,0:00:38.079
introduce yourself hello my name is

0:00:36.399,0:00:41.200
keegan fisher

0:00:38.079,0:00:43.440
and you hi i'm mckinley

0:00:41.200,0:00:44.640
you guys ready for your last day yes

0:00:43.440,0:00:46.079
super duper

0:00:44.640,0:00:48.719
so today's actually going to be kind of

0:00:46.079,0:00:52.079
fun we're going to do a project called

0:00:48.719,0:00:54.079
advanced kaleidoscope and the first part

0:00:52.079,0:00:55.440
is going to be regular kaleidoscope and

0:00:54.079,0:00:56.719
mckinley is going to teach it

0:00:55.440,0:00:59.120
but first i'm going to introduce kind of

0:00:56.719,0:01:01.840
what we're doing uh so the thing we're

0:00:59.120,0:01:04.320
doing is a kaleidoscope so that's a fun

0:01:01.840,0:01:06.080
word to say that's for sure

0:01:04.320,0:01:07.600
and there's a solution here which i

0:01:06.080,0:01:08.479
thought was already up but it now is it

0:01:07.600,0:01:10.640
up

0:01:08.479,0:01:12.000
so the way the solution works is it will

0:01:10.640,0:01:14.080
ask you

0:01:12.000,0:01:16.000
how many sprites would you like so this

0:01:14.080,0:01:17.439
is kind of part of the advanced thing

0:01:16.000,0:01:20.000
i'm going to say that i want five

0:01:17.439,0:01:21.680
sprites and what it does is it lets you

0:01:20.000,0:01:23.360
use the arrow keys

0:01:21.680,0:01:24.720
to move around your five sprites and you

0:01:23.360,0:01:26.320
can use left and right

0:01:24.720,0:01:28.159
to kind of make neat patterns and things

0:01:26.320,0:01:30.400
like that

0:01:28.159,0:01:32.000
it of course doesn't have to be five so

0:01:30.400,0:01:33.439
if you run it again

0:01:32.000,0:01:35.360
it'll ask you how many sprites would you

0:01:33.439,0:01:38.799
like let's say i want

0:01:35.360,0:01:40.560
i don't know 40 sprites so it'll make 40

0:01:38.799,0:01:41.040
individual sprites and now when you do

0:01:40.560,0:01:42.960
it

0:01:41.040,0:01:44.320
it'll actually kind of move all 40 which

0:01:42.960,0:01:46.240
admittedly kind of always look like

0:01:44.320,0:01:47.680
circles

0:01:46.240,0:01:49.439
you can also do a thing where you can

0:01:47.680,0:01:51.280
switch the costumes so you can kind of

0:01:49.439,0:01:52.799
like change everybody's color

0:01:51.280,0:01:55.600
to make another neat pattern and things

0:01:52.799,0:01:57.200
like that so it's a it's a neat program

0:01:55.600,0:01:58.799
you can do a lot of like crazy shapes

0:01:57.200,0:02:00.880
and things with it you've probably seen

0:01:58.799,0:02:02.640
like some of mckinley's

0:02:00.880,0:02:04.079
patterns but she does these crazy

0:02:02.640,0:02:07.200
kaleidoscope things

0:02:04.079,0:02:08.640
so that's the goal today it's kind of

0:02:07.200,0:02:11.200
meant to be a little bit shorter

0:02:08.640,0:02:12.560
uh is is the hope um and we're going to

0:02:11.200,0:02:14.640
also kind of test you

0:02:12.560,0:02:15.520
uh on a couple things so the first thing

0:02:14.640,0:02:16.959
we're going to do is we're going to

0:02:15.520,0:02:19.360
build what i consider a

0:02:16.959,0:02:21.040
regular kaleidoscope and then we're

0:02:19.360,0:02:22.959
going to have you turn it into like

0:02:21.040,0:02:24.959
using clones and things like that

0:02:22.959,0:02:27.200
so for regular kaleidoscope i'm actually

0:02:24.959,0:02:28.560
going to have mckinley come up

0:02:27.200,0:02:29.760
and she's going to lead us through this

0:02:28.560,0:02:30.480
this is going to be the same if you

0:02:29.760,0:02:32.800
happen to work

0:02:30.480,0:02:35.040
week one this is going to be the same as

0:02:32.800,0:02:36.480
what we did on day five of week one

0:02:35.040,0:02:38.879
so we're gonna do that together and then

0:02:36.480,0:02:39.840
we're gonna make it into advanced uh

0:02:38.879,0:02:41.200
version

0:02:39.840,0:02:43.760
all right mckinley come on up it's all

0:02:41.200,0:02:45.920
yours hi my name is mckinley fisher in

0:02:43.760,0:02:49.840
case you've forgotten

0:02:45.920,0:02:53.040
and i'm going to be building the uh

0:02:49.840,0:02:53.760
kaleidoscope code so the first thing you

0:02:53.040,0:02:57.360
need to do

0:02:53.760,0:03:00.000
is go to scratch.mit.edu

0:02:57.360,0:03:03.120
and then create a new game and your

0:03:00.000,0:03:03.120
screen should look like this

0:03:03.200,0:03:11.040
the first thing you're going to do

0:03:06.480,0:03:14.159
is to delete the cat sprite

0:03:11.040,0:03:18.959
and add a new sprite

0:03:14.159,0:03:21.120
this new spray is going to be ball

0:03:18.959,0:03:22.239
and your bell sprite should have shown

0:03:21.120,0:03:25.440
up on

0:03:22.239,0:03:28.080
on the screen and then

0:03:25.440,0:03:30.840
um we're gonna start with a green flag

0:03:28.080,0:03:33.840
when green flagged

0:03:30.840,0:03:33.840
clicked

0:03:33.920,0:03:41.840
and then we are going to choose

0:03:38.560,0:03:44.080
what direction it's pointing in so

0:03:41.840,0:03:45.599
we're gonna have this ballpoint in

0:03:44.080,0:03:49.280
direction zero

0:03:45.599,0:03:51.760
so it's a pointing straight up

0:03:49.280,0:03:53.040
and then we're gonna have it go to zero

0:03:51.760,0:04:01.519
zero the exact

0:03:53.040,0:04:04.640
middle of the screen

0:04:01.519,0:04:10.080
once you do that you're going to

0:04:04.640,0:04:11.920
go into control and find a forever loop

0:04:10.080,0:04:14.159
okay so i zoomed in a little so you

0:04:11.920,0:04:17.199
could um see better

0:04:14.159,0:04:19.440
and so this is our code so far when

0:04:17.199,0:04:20.880
green flag clicked point in direction go

0:04:19.440,0:04:24.000
to

0:04:20.880,0:04:27.199
x0 y0 and then a forever loop

0:04:24.000,0:04:30.639
in that parabola loop you're gonna put

0:04:27.199,0:04:30.639
four if statements

0:04:37.840,0:04:42.720
inside of those if statements you're

0:04:39.919,0:04:46.000
going to go to sensing

0:04:42.720,0:04:57.360
and put in a key space

0:04:46.000,0:05:00.080
press for each of them

0:04:57.360,0:05:00.639
once you do do that you're going to

0:05:00.080,0:05:04.639
change

0:05:00.639,0:05:08.320
space to up

0:05:04.639,0:05:12.560
down left

0:05:08.320,0:05:12.560
and right arrow key

0:05:14.740,0:05:18.960
[Music]

0:05:16.880,0:05:19.919
once you do that you're going to go back

0:05:18.960,0:05:23.199
up to motion

0:05:19.919,0:05:25.759
so that you can actually move

0:05:23.199,0:05:27.600
and for the up arrow key you want to

0:05:25.759,0:05:30.880
drag in a move

0:05:27.600,0:05:34.479
10 steps so now if you were

0:05:30.880,0:05:36.160
to run your program and press the up

0:05:34.479,0:05:39.440
arrow key your ball would move

0:05:36.160,0:05:41.520
but no other keys would work

0:05:39.440,0:05:44.960
we're actually going to change that 10

0:05:41.520,0:05:44.960
steps to 3

0:05:46.320,0:05:50.160
and we're going to do almost the exact

0:05:48.000,0:05:52.080
same thing for the down arrow

0:05:50.160,0:05:54.800
except that we're going to do negative

0:05:52.080,0:05:54.800
three steps

0:05:58.800,0:06:02.240
now if you run your program your balls

0:06:00.720,0:06:06.960
should be able to go down

0:06:02.240,0:06:09.919
and up

0:06:06.960,0:06:10.319
for left arrow key you're gonna um you

0:06:09.919,0:06:13.520
see

0:06:10.319,0:06:14.160
these two turn blocks the one that is

0:06:13.520,0:06:17.440
turning

0:06:14.160,0:06:21.199
left 15 degrees you're going to drag

0:06:17.440,0:06:24.639
into the left arrow

0:06:21.199,0:06:26.400
you're going to change that 15 to 5

0:06:24.639,0:06:28.080
and then for the right arrow you're

0:06:26.400,0:06:31.680
going to choose the

0:06:28.080,0:06:35.520
turn that is turning right and change

0:06:31.680,0:06:37.280
that to 5 as well

0:06:35.520,0:06:39.280
now if you run your program you should

0:06:37.280,0:06:42.319
be able to move your ball around

0:06:39.280,0:06:44.800
however you would like

0:06:42.319,0:06:46.880
now that's great but it's quite a bit

0:06:44.800,0:06:47.199
boring so we're now we're going to make

0:06:46.880,0:06:50.160
the

0:06:47.199,0:06:53.440
kaleidoscope part of it to that to do

0:06:50.160,0:06:57.599
that you have to go into extensions

0:06:53.440,0:07:03.199
and your screen should um look like this

0:06:57.599,0:07:06.160
and you're going to click on the pen

0:07:03.199,0:07:08.639
so now you see that opens um got you

0:07:06.160,0:07:10.400
some new blocks

0:07:08.639,0:07:12.080
so the first block that you're going to

0:07:10.400,0:07:15.680
drag in from this new

0:07:12.080,0:07:18.400
area is erase all

0:07:15.680,0:07:20.000
and you're going to put that at the very

0:07:18.400,0:07:22.319
top

0:07:20.000,0:07:23.680
or it could be underneath point

0:07:22.319,0:07:27.120
direction and go to

0:07:23.680,0:07:27.759
your choice now you're going to put a

0:07:27.120,0:07:31.199
stamp

0:07:27.759,0:07:32.319
under the move 3 and so now if you run

0:07:31.199,0:07:35.440
your program

0:07:32.319,0:07:37.360
it should leave a trail

0:07:35.440,0:07:39.120
so that's the first step of your

0:07:37.360,0:07:42.240
kaleidoscope

0:07:39.120,0:07:43.440
now this is optional but you can put a

0:07:42.240,0:07:46.319
stamp block

0:07:43.440,0:07:47.039
under the backwards arrow so that way if

0:07:46.319,0:07:49.680
you move

0:07:47.039,0:07:50.720
backwards it'll also leave a trail that

0:07:49.680,0:07:54.319
is completely

0:07:50.720,0:07:55.919
optional to you so now you should be

0:07:54.319,0:07:57.360
able to move your ball around and it

0:07:55.919,0:08:00.479
should leave a colored

0:07:57.360,0:08:02.560
trail and that looks pretty good but now

0:08:00.479,0:08:04.720
we're going to add two more balls

0:08:02.560,0:08:06.800
to do that you're going to click on the

0:08:04.720,0:08:09.520
ball and you're going to click on

0:08:06.800,0:08:10.560
duplicate so now you should have a

0:08:09.520,0:08:12.319
second ball

0:08:10.560,0:08:13.840
and you're gonna duplicate it one more

0:08:12.319,0:08:18.240
time and

0:08:13.840,0:08:18.240
you should have three balls in total

0:08:18.319,0:08:21.440
now the first thing you're going to do

0:08:19.840,0:08:23.680
to these other balls is

0:08:21.440,0:08:24.479
you can change the color of all your

0:08:23.680,0:08:26.160
balls

0:08:24.479,0:08:28.800
so you see that the balls already have

0:08:26.160,0:08:31.680
built-in costumes of different colors

0:08:28.800,0:08:33.760
for the first ball i'm going to choose a

0:08:31.680,0:08:36.800
blue costume

0:08:33.760,0:08:40.640
for the second ball i'm going to choose

0:08:36.800,0:08:43.839
a green costume and for the third ball

0:08:40.640,0:08:46.080
i'm going to choose a purple

0:08:43.839,0:08:48.880
and so now you see that my balls are all

0:08:46.080,0:08:48.880
different colors

0:08:49.440,0:08:52.959
and they should and they all were the

0:08:51.920,0:08:55.120
only problem is

0:08:52.959,0:08:57.440
is that they're always on top of each

0:08:55.120,0:09:01.120
other to change that

0:08:57.440,0:09:04.240
you're gonna go um into ball two's

0:09:01.120,0:09:05.600
code it's gonna look exactly the same as

0:09:04.240,0:09:08.240
the first ball

0:09:05.600,0:09:09.440
but there's one modification that we

0:09:08.240,0:09:11.600
need to make

0:09:09.440,0:09:13.040
so you see this line that says point in

0:09:11.600,0:09:15.120
direction zero

0:09:13.040,0:09:16.720
that's duplicated from the first ball

0:09:15.120,0:09:20.880
you're gonna change that zero

0:09:16.720,0:09:22.000
to one twenty and so now if you run your

0:09:20.880,0:09:24.800
program you see

0:09:22.000,0:09:25.760
you'll see that the green ball moves a

0:09:24.800,0:09:29.040
slightly different

0:09:25.760,0:09:30.720
um different from the blue ball and the

0:09:29.040,0:09:31.680
purple ball because it's pointing a

0:09:30.720,0:09:33.839
different direction

0:09:31.680,0:09:35.680
at the start you're going to do almost

0:09:33.839,0:09:38.120
the same thing to ball three

0:09:35.680,0:09:40.800
except that it's going to be negative

0:09:38.120,0:09:44.160
120.

0:09:40.800,0:09:47.839
if you run your program you should have

0:09:44.160,0:09:50.160
a regular kaleidoscope and so

0:09:47.839,0:09:51.440
now you can play around with it and that

0:09:50.160,0:09:54.160
you can

0:09:51.440,0:09:56.160
um you programmed the um regular

0:09:54.160,0:09:56.560
kaleidoscope now my dad's going to take

0:09:56.160,0:09:59.839
over

0:09:56.560,0:10:02.079
and make the advanced kaleidoscope

0:09:59.839,0:10:03.200
all right that was that was awesome sis

0:10:02.079,0:10:05.120
so she made

0:10:03.200,0:10:06.399
a kaleidoscope just like we did last

0:10:05.120,0:10:08.800
week and she did it uh

0:10:06.399,0:10:10.240
perfectly the only thing that i would

0:10:08.800,0:10:13.200
change is i don't take this uh

0:10:10.240,0:10:14.720
stamp on the the negative direction of a

0:10:13.200,0:10:15.760
difference that mckinley and i have had

0:10:14.720,0:10:18.000
for a long time

0:10:15.760,0:10:19.680
so everything is working and everything

0:10:18.000,0:10:21.440
is good

0:10:19.680,0:10:23.040
but you know the advanced version we

0:10:21.440,0:10:24.640
want to do more so there's

0:10:23.040,0:10:26.320
two reasons we want to make an advanced

0:10:24.640,0:10:28.480
version well number one

0:10:26.320,0:10:29.760
reason is that we want to make it to

0:10:28.480,0:10:32.079
where you can actually

0:10:29.760,0:10:33.839
select how many of these balls you want

0:10:32.079,0:10:36.079
right so you know you might want to say

0:10:33.839,0:10:37.440
seven or something like that and then

0:10:36.079,0:10:39.440
you can make seven and now

0:10:37.440,0:10:40.959
we don't want to make seven balls right

0:10:39.440,0:10:42.880
that would take forever to duplicate

0:10:40.959,0:10:44.480
make seven you could also do things like

0:10:42.880,0:10:46.480
a hundred right

0:10:44.480,0:10:48.240
so you would never want to actually like

0:10:46.480,0:10:51.120
duplicate the sprite

0:10:48.240,0:10:52.640
99 times and make 100 of them but you

0:10:51.120,0:10:54.079
can see that with this version of the

0:10:52.640,0:10:56.640
advanced kaleidoscope

0:10:54.079,0:10:58.000
you actually can make 100 sprites of

0:10:56.640,0:11:00.320
something

0:10:58.000,0:11:01.519
and the solution to this duplication is

0:11:00.320,0:11:03.200
to clone something

0:11:01.519,0:11:04.800
so that's one of the big advantages of

0:11:03.200,0:11:05.920
cloning is that you can have as many of

0:11:04.800,0:11:07.920
something as you want

0:11:05.920,0:11:09.600
the other advantage is let's say that

0:11:07.920,0:11:10.160
you did want to make a change to your

0:11:09.600,0:11:11.519
code

0:11:10.160,0:11:13.360
so if i wanted to make a change to this

0:11:11.519,0:11:15.440
code let's say i wanted to take out this

0:11:13.360,0:11:17.519
stamp on the negative direction well if

0:11:15.440,0:11:19.040
i take it out of one of them

0:11:17.519,0:11:21.040
and i go forwards and i turn and then i

0:11:19.040,0:11:22.959
go backwards you can see that their code

0:11:21.040,0:11:24.560
is actually different right

0:11:22.959,0:11:26.640
and so that's another reason that you

0:11:24.560,0:11:27.600
prefer clones instead of duplicating

0:11:26.640,0:11:29.519
sprites

0:11:27.600,0:11:31.200
so here's what i want to do i want to

0:11:29.519,0:11:32.240
get it down to where there's only one

0:11:31.200,0:11:34.240
sprite again

0:11:32.240,0:11:36.640
so i'm going to delete the second and

0:11:34.240,0:11:38.800
this third copy

0:11:36.640,0:11:41.839
and my goal is to make just this one

0:11:38.800,0:11:44.000
sprite be my only sprite in the game

0:11:41.839,0:11:45.040
and then to make clones of it the other

0:11:44.000,0:11:47.920
thing i'll say is that

0:11:45.040,0:11:49.600
since we're using clone tricks you don't

0:11:47.920,0:11:50.079
really care about where this ball starts

0:11:49.600,0:11:51.600
at all

0:11:50.079,0:11:53.040
um in fact you can just kind of like put

0:11:51.600,0:11:54.240
it off into space just kind of like

0:11:53.040,0:11:56.160
prove that fact

0:11:54.240,0:11:57.839
and you can also hide it right because

0:11:56.160,0:11:59.200
that's the original we don't care about

0:11:57.839,0:12:00.639
the original at all that's a pretty

0:11:59.200,0:12:04.240
common trick with clones that

0:12:00.639,0:12:06.320
we just hide the original and then also

0:12:04.240,0:12:08.240
uh whenever we're dealing with clones we

0:12:06.320,0:12:08.959
actually don't use wind green flag

0:12:08.240,0:12:10.880
clicks

0:12:08.959,0:12:12.480
so i'm going to take that off of when

0:12:10.880,0:12:15.279
green flag clicked

0:12:12.480,0:12:16.240
and i'm instead going to control and i'm

0:12:15.279,0:12:20.160
going to find

0:12:16.240,0:12:21.680
when i start as clone and so that's also

0:12:20.160,0:12:24.000
another trick that we use for clones a

0:12:21.680,0:12:26.000
lot now the thing we've got to remember

0:12:24.000,0:12:27.360
is how were the sprites different uh and

0:12:26.000,0:12:27.839
the way that they were different was

0:12:27.360,0:12:31.200
this

0:12:27.839,0:12:32.480
point in direction so the trick we've

0:12:31.200,0:12:33.519
used in the past and i'm going to go

0:12:32.480,0:12:34.320
ahead and get you kind of started on

0:12:33.519,0:12:36.880
this here

0:12:34.320,0:12:37.440
is we've made a variable um that we've

0:12:36.880,0:12:40.399
like

0:12:37.440,0:12:41.680
set and then we've done the clone if you

0:12:40.399,0:12:42.959
uh hopefully can kind of remember that

0:12:41.680,0:12:43.839
trick so i'm going to make a variable

0:12:42.959,0:12:48.800
called

0:12:43.839,0:12:48.800
uh the starting direction

0:12:49.040,0:12:53.680
and i again use my camel case system for

0:12:51.920,0:12:55.760
starting direction and it's going to be

0:12:53.680,0:12:57.680
for all sprites

0:12:55.760,0:12:59.839
so now what i want you to try to do and

0:12:57.680,0:13:01.680
this is going to be a little tricky

0:12:59.839,0:13:03.040
i don't really need to show the starting

0:13:01.680,0:13:05.200
direction variable

0:13:03.040,0:13:06.720
is i want you to see if you remember

0:13:05.200,0:13:08.639
some of the skills we've used in this

0:13:06.720,0:13:10.480
camp for making clones

0:13:08.639,0:13:12.079
and see if you can do it on your own and

0:13:10.480,0:13:13.760
so this clone right here

0:13:12.079,0:13:17.120
is almost done the only thing he's

0:13:13.760,0:13:19.040
missing is a is a show command

0:13:17.120,0:13:20.160
i usually like to show it after i do the

0:13:19.040,0:13:21.519
go to

0:13:20.160,0:13:23.920
but that's because the original is

0:13:21.519,0:13:27.120
invisible and then this guy showed

0:13:23.920,0:13:30.639
so he is almost done he needs

0:13:27.120,0:13:33.120
this point in direction to actually use

0:13:30.639,0:13:34.959
this variable

0:13:33.120,0:13:36.480
and the thing i want you to just try on

0:13:34.959,0:13:38.480
your own it's going to be a challenge

0:13:36.480,0:13:40.160
is i want you to try writing the code

0:13:38.480,0:13:42.880
that's going to make

0:13:40.160,0:13:44.959
three balls and so i want you to make

0:13:42.880,0:13:46.639
three balls three clones

0:13:44.959,0:13:49.199
and typically where we put code like

0:13:46.639,0:13:52.560
that is over on the stage

0:13:49.199,0:13:55.920
so you're going to have to you know

0:13:52.560,0:13:57.680
make a clone change the starting angle

0:13:55.920,0:13:59.120
make another clone change the starting

0:13:57.680,0:14:01.600
angle make another clone

0:13:59.120,0:14:03.279
change the starting angle if you can i'd

0:14:01.600,0:14:03.920
rather you did it with a loop instead of

0:14:03.279,0:14:05.600
just three

0:14:03.920,0:14:07.120
three of those statements and also

0:14:05.600,0:14:09.040
remember there's a little bug to where

0:14:07.120,0:14:11.040
you should put a small delay

0:14:09.040,0:14:13.600
after you create your clone so take a

0:14:11.040,0:14:14.959
minute you can review some old code if

0:14:13.600,0:14:16.639
that helps you

0:14:14.959,0:14:18.720
but see if you can write the code for

0:14:16.639,0:14:20.399
the stage yourself without my help

0:14:18.720,0:14:21.839
i'll come back i'll write it in a minute

0:14:20.399,0:14:22.240
um but see if you can write it without

0:14:21.839,0:14:24.880
your

0:14:22.240,0:14:26.959
without my help to make three bowls they

0:14:24.880,0:14:28.079
will all be the same color right now

0:14:26.959,0:14:31.440
that's okay

0:14:28.079,0:14:32.880
but see if you can do that

0:14:31.440,0:14:34.959
all right i think my camper's got it

0:14:32.880,0:14:35.519
mckinley knocked it out uh no problem at

0:14:34.959,0:14:37.680
all uh

0:14:35.519,0:14:38.560
keegan's uh not quite his experience uh

0:14:37.680,0:14:40.880
i helped him some

0:14:38.560,0:14:42.399
but but he did get it um i'm not

0:14:40.880,0:14:43.360
expecting you to get it i just wanted

0:14:42.399,0:14:44.959
you to try

0:14:43.360,0:14:46.800
so i'm going to write it with you so

0:14:44.959,0:14:48.480
this is on the stage

0:14:46.800,0:14:51.600
so things start when the green flag is

0:14:48.480,0:14:52.959
clicked so that's a good way to start

0:14:51.600,0:14:54.480
and then what i know i'm going to do is

0:14:52.959,0:14:56.240
i know i'm going to repeat something

0:14:54.480,0:14:58.000
three times

0:14:56.240,0:15:00.160
and the thing i'm going to repeat is

0:14:58.000,0:15:02.959
going to involve making a clone

0:15:00.160,0:15:04.320
so i'm going to say create clone of ball

0:15:02.959,0:15:06.000
uh and then the little bug that we've

0:15:04.320,0:15:07.440
kind of learned about is that you need a

0:15:06.000,0:15:08.800
small delay

0:15:07.440,0:15:11.120
after you create the clone with the

0:15:08.800,0:15:13.360
tricks we're using um and so now i just

0:15:11.120,0:15:14.720
need to uh if i if i did this uh you

0:15:13.360,0:15:16.959
know i could put it on and run it

0:15:14.720,0:15:18.560
um but it's going to create three bowls

0:15:16.959,0:15:21.680
that are all right on top of each other

0:15:18.560,0:15:23.360
right so not quite what i was after uh

0:15:21.680,0:15:25.600
if i go into variables what i really

0:15:23.360,0:15:28.639
want to do is i want to set

0:15:25.600,0:15:29.600
that starting direction to zero at the

0:15:28.639,0:15:30.959
beginning

0:15:29.600,0:15:32.720
and you can see that the ball has

0:15:30.959,0:15:33.680
already used that variable starting

0:15:32.720,0:15:35.199
direction

0:15:33.680,0:15:36.959
and so i want to set it to zero there

0:15:35.199,0:15:39.199
and then i want to change it

0:15:36.959,0:15:40.000
after i make a ball so my starting

0:15:39.199,0:15:41.199
direction and the amount

0:15:40.000,0:15:43.199
i wanted to change it back if you

0:15:41.199,0:15:46.560
remember from the simple version uh

0:15:43.199,0:15:48.720
is 120 and the reason it's 120 is

0:15:46.560,0:15:49.920
because there's three bowls

0:15:48.720,0:15:52.320
and all the way around the circle would

0:15:49.920,0:15:55.120
be 360. so 360

0:15:52.320,0:15:56.880
divided by 3 is 120 so that's how i got

0:15:55.120,0:15:58.240
that value

0:15:56.880,0:15:59.839
and i'm also going to delete this my

0:15:58.240,0:16:01.360
variable just because it was annoying me

0:15:59.839,0:16:02.639
so i'm going to delete my variable

0:16:01.360,0:16:04.240
variable

0:16:02.639,0:16:05.680
i did not delete starting direction so i

0:16:04.240,0:16:08.720
just deleted this one

0:16:05.680,0:16:11.440
and so now it does what i want and it

0:16:08.720,0:16:13.360
actually like makes three clones

0:16:11.440,0:16:15.120
and it works kind of like it did before

0:16:13.360,0:16:16.560
the only problem that you see now is

0:16:15.120,0:16:18.000
that they're all blue

0:16:16.560,0:16:20.079
and so we want to do something to make

0:16:18.000,0:16:22.480
them not all blue there's a couple

0:16:20.079,0:16:23.920
different solutions to this

0:16:22.480,0:16:25.440
but i think what i'm going to do just to

0:16:23.920,0:16:27.759
keep it simple is i'm just going to

0:16:25.440,0:16:28.959
randomly pick a costume i think that's

0:16:27.759,0:16:31.120
that's good enough for this step because

0:16:28.959,0:16:34.800
we're going to change it later anyway

0:16:31.120,0:16:37.839
so go into looks i go into switch

0:16:34.800,0:16:40.720
costume 2 and i'm just going to stick it

0:16:37.839,0:16:42.959
just before my show here

0:16:40.720,0:16:45.279
and you might remember you can address

0:16:42.959,0:16:47.839
costumes by their name

0:16:45.279,0:16:48.959
or by their number and so if we look at

0:16:47.839,0:16:51.839
this ball

0:16:48.959,0:16:54.000
we can see that it's got five costumes

0:16:51.839,0:16:56.959
and so a good way to randomly pick one

0:16:54.000,0:16:57.839
is to go into operators and say pick

0:16:56.959,0:16:59.199
random

0:16:57.839,0:17:00.959
and so we're going to refer to it by

0:16:59.199,0:17:02.639
number and we're going to pick one from

0:17:00.959,0:17:04.480
one to five

0:17:02.639,0:17:06.319
now this isn't a great solution because

0:17:04.480,0:17:07.760
it could have duplicates uh so like

0:17:06.319,0:17:11.199
there you know i had two

0:17:07.760,0:17:13.199
um yellows uh here i've got two purples

0:17:11.199,0:17:14.799
uh there i finally got uh all three

0:17:13.199,0:17:16.160
colors the other way you could have

0:17:14.799,0:17:17.600
written that is you could have like made

0:17:16.160,0:17:19.679
a variable called like

0:17:17.600,0:17:21.199
costume number and then you could have

0:17:19.679,0:17:22.000
like indexed through it one two and

0:17:21.199,0:17:23.280
three

0:17:22.000,0:17:25.439
but we're going to change how we want to

0:17:23.280,0:17:28.000
do it anyway

0:17:25.439,0:17:29.360
cool so things are going really well the

0:17:28.000,0:17:29.840
next thing i want to do is going to be a

0:17:29.360,0:17:32.880
little

0:17:29.840,0:17:33.600
trickier we want to do not just three

0:17:32.880,0:17:37.200
balls

0:17:33.600,0:17:39.120
but we want to do any number of balls

0:17:37.200,0:17:40.320
all right so [ __ ] was jumping out of

0:17:39.120,0:17:41.760
her seat because she already figured it

0:17:40.320,0:17:44.720
out so i told her that she could show

0:17:41.760,0:17:47.760
you how to do it so take it over sis

0:17:44.720,0:17:49.760
okay so i have figured out the secret of

0:17:47.760,0:17:53.039
making much more balls

0:17:49.760,0:17:55.039
how to do is you go to stage and

0:17:53.039,0:17:57.440
you see that we already have this code

0:17:55.039,0:18:00.000
here you're gonna go to sensing

0:17:57.440,0:18:01.280
it has this built-in question that is

0:18:00.000,0:18:02.720
very handy for

0:18:01.280,0:18:04.400
the type of thing we're about to be

0:18:02.720,0:18:07.120
doing so you're gonna

0:18:04.400,0:18:07.840
um drag over ask what's your name and

0:18:07.120,0:18:09.280
weight

0:18:07.840,0:18:11.600
and you're gonna put it at the top of

0:18:09.280,0:18:12.160
the code you're gonna change what's your

0:18:11.600,0:18:16.880
name

0:18:12.160,0:18:21.679
to how many balls

0:18:16.880,0:18:21.679
do you want

0:18:22.080,0:18:26.960
and then you wait and then um instead of

0:18:25.440,0:18:30.000
repeating three times

0:18:26.960,0:18:33.360
you're gonna repeat the answer so

0:18:30.000,0:18:35.760
like if you put in 26 balls

0:18:33.360,0:18:37.440
uh that would be the answer repeat 26

0:18:35.760,0:18:40.880
balls to make 26

0:18:37.440,0:18:42.640
uh clones of the ball and then um

0:18:40.880,0:18:44.080
one last thing with the answer is you

0:18:42.640,0:18:46.720
need to go

0:18:44.080,0:18:47.440
into operators and define find this

0:18:46.720,0:18:50.559
division

0:18:47.440,0:18:51.120
sign now you're going to take 360 which

0:18:50.559,0:18:54.160
is

0:18:51.120,0:18:56.480
um all the degrees in a circle and

0:18:54.160,0:18:59.760
divide it by the answer so all your

0:18:56.480,0:19:02.960
balls are equally spaced out

0:18:59.760,0:19:06.160
and so once you do that it should work

0:19:02.960,0:19:09.039
and so if i say 26

0:19:06.160,0:19:10.400
balls and i hit enter should make all

0:19:09.039,0:19:13.679
those balls and

0:19:10.400,0:19:17.679
so um that is how you make

0:19:13.679,0:19:17.679
multiple clones of the ball

0:19:17.919,0:19:22.160
all right sis you're very clever uh by

0:19:20.080,0:19:23.760
the way my son keegan discovered that if

0:19:22.160,0:19:25.360
you type in like a bunch of balls like

0:19:23.760,0:19:27.039
123

0:19:25.360,0:19:28.720
and you start driving like before it

0:19:27.039,0:19:31.200
finishes making them you can kind of

0:19:28.720,0:19:32.240
like make a weird stream pattern of them

0:19:31.200,0:19:33.840
as well right so there's

0:19:32.240,0:19:35.679
there's all kinds of crazy things that

0:19:33.840,0:19:39.200
you can do it looks really kind of like

0:19:35.679,0:19:41.919
spooky right so

0:19:39.200,0:19:42.480
that's great i am totally happy with

0:19:41.919,0:19:44.240
that

0:19:42.480,0:19:46.160
you can see that it is only picking

0:19:44.240,0:19:47.919
these five different colors

0:19:46.160,0:19:49.440
this is an optional step that i'm going

0:19:47.919,0:19:51.760
to show you next is

0:19:49.440,0:19:53.520
you don't have to just use costumes

0:19:51.760,0:19:54.320
there's actually more things you can do

0:19:53.520,0:19:57.039
with like

0:19:54.320,0:19:59.440
looks than just changing costumes so

0:19:57.039,0:20:01.520
just to show you that you can do this

0:19:59.440,0:20:03.039
there's all kinds of graphic effects

0:20:01.520,0:20:06.640
that you can set

0:20:03.039,0:20:08.559
and so we're going to set the color

0:20:06.640,0:20:10.480
to a random number so instead of

0:20:08.559,0:20:13.039
switching the costume

0:20:10.480,0:20:14.559
i'm going to set the color to a random

0:20:13.039,0:20:16.000
number

0:20:14.559,0:20:18.159
i'm going to get this switch costume out

0:20:16.000,0:20:20.799
of here because i won't need it

0:20:18.159,0:20:22.480
and so i just changed it instead of set

0:20:20.799,0:20:23.440
the costume number i'm going to set the

0:20:22.480,0:20:24.720
color effect

0:20:23.440,0:20:26.480
you can see that there's a lot of

0:20:24.720,0:20:28.640
effects that you can do to your sprites

0:20:26.480,0:20:31.039
color is what we want here it actually

0:20:28.640,0:20:33.120
goes from 1 to 200

0:20:31.039,0:20:34.240
i have no idea why it goes from 1 to 200

0:20:33.120,0:20:35.360
but i had to look it up and

0:20:34.240,0:20:38.000
it apparently goes from one to two

0:20:35.360,0:20:39.280
hundred and so now if i put in say eight

0:20:38.000,0:20:42.320
bowls

0:20:39.280,0:20:45.520
you can see that it'll randomly pick

0:20:42.320,0:20:47.520
a variety of colors so it's using uh the

0:20:45.520,0:20:50.080
blue as the starting point

0:20:47.520,0:20:52.480
and then it's randomly changing it by up

0:20:50.080,0:20:55.039
to 200. so if we run it again

0:20:52.480,0:20:56.240
it'll be different colors i kind of like

0:20:55.039,0:20:58.480
that pattern that looks really good it's

0:20:56.240,0:21:00.559
almost like a rainbow

0:20:58.480,0:21:02.640
so that is an optional change you can

0:21:00.559,0:21:04.640
stick with the costumes if you prefer

0:21:02.640,0:21:06.240
but i wanted to show you about how you

0:21:04.640,0:21:08.799
can actually change other

0:21:06.240,0:21:09.280
graphic effects the next thing i want to

0:21:08.799,0:21:11.840
do

0:21:09.280,0:21:12.960
if you look at the solution over here is

0:21:11.840,0:21:15.600
that it makes a

0:21:12.960,0:21:16.960
button to switch costumes so if i said

0:21:15.600,0:21:17.919
eight sprites

0:21:16.960,0:21:19.919
you know i could do it with eight

0:21:17.919,0:21:22.159
sprites but it's got this button that

0:21:19.919,0:21:23.919
you can click on and say next

0:21:22.159,0:21:25.360
and then it'll switch everybody's color

0:21:23.919,0:21:27.440
to the next costume

0:21:25.360,0:21:30.080
and we haven't used buttons uh in

0:21:27.440,0:21:32.400
sprites uh sorry buttons in scratch

0:21:30.080,0:21:34.000
but it's actually pretty easy to do and

0:21:32.400,0:21:34.400
i thought that since the camp is almost

0:21:34.000,0:21:37.200
over

0:21:34.400,0:21:38.640
i'll let show you a button uh so let's

0:21:37.200,0:21:39.440
put a button in here i'm going to save

0:21:38.640,0:21:43.400
it first

0:21:39.440,0:21:44.720
so this is going to be saved as collide

0:21:43.400,0:21:48.480
collidoscope

0:21:44.720,0:21:51.280
uh advanced uh kaleidoscope is so hard

0:21:48.480,0:21:52.960
to spell uh e-i-d-o is the important

0:21:51.280,0:21:56.080
part in kaleidoscope

0:21:52.960,0:21:57.760
um and so now i'm gonna make that button

0:21:56.080,0:21:59.200
all right so i'm gonna make a new sprite

0:21:57.760,0:21:59.840
here so the button is actually a new

0:21:59.200,0:22:01.280
sprite

0:21:59.840,0:22:02.960
and they're actually built in so just

0:22:01.280,0:22:04.559
click on choose a sprite just click on

0:22:02.960,0:22:06.640
the circle here

0:22:04.559,0:22:07.760
um and then you can probably find it i

0:22:06.640,0:22:10.480
just want the one that's called

0:22:07.760,0:22:11.600
button 2 you can use button 1 or button

0:22:10.480,0:22:12.000
3 if you wanted but i'm going to use

0:22:11.600,0:22:15.600
button

0:22:12.000,0:22:17.360
2. button 2 you can see comes in two

0:22:15.600,0:22:19.919
varieties it can be orange or blue i

0:22:17.360,0:22:22.000
kind of like the blue the best

0:22:19.919,0:22:22.960
and then if you want you can put words

0:22:22.000,0:22:25.679
on your button

0:22:22.960,0:22:26.880
so i'm going to click on the text here

0:22:25.679,0:22:28.720
and i'm going to make

0:22:26.880,0:22:31.120
white text so i'm going to switch this

0:22:28.720,0:22:35.200
to some white color

0:22:31.120,0:22:37.280
and then i'm going to type the word next

0:22:35.200,0:22:38.559
and you can see that the word next is

0:22:37.280,0:22:39.200
currently a little smaller than the

0:22:38.559,0:22:40.640
button

0:22:39.200,0:22:42.640
you could fix this one or two ways you

0:22:40.640,0:22:44.720
could either make the button smaller

0:22:42.640,0:22:46.320
or you could make the text bigger either

0:22:44.720,0:22:48.240
one works i think it might be easier to

0:22:46.320,0:22:49.440
make the text bigger personally

0:22:48.240,0:22:52.159
so i'm just going to make the text

0:22:49.440,0:22:54.080
bigger and i'm not worried about the

0:22:52.159,0:22:56.080
overall size yet because the size

0:22:54.080,0:22:58.320
up here i'm going to change it with the

0:22:56.080,0:22:58.799
size that's right here so i can change

0:22:58.320,0:23:01.120
the

0:22:58.799,0:23:03.039
the whole thing very easily i just

0:23:01.120,0:23:06.320
wanted to get the relative size

0:23:03.039,0:23:07.600
of the button to the text right so play

0:23:06.320,0:23:08.880
around until you're happy with your

0:23:07.600,0:23:10.960
button

0:23:08.880,0:23:12.080
i think that looks pretty good there and

0:23:10.960,0:23:13.919
then i'm going to choose to put it

0:23:12.080,0:23:14.720
basically just right up in the corner so

0:23:13.919,0:23:16.240
i think that

0:23:14.720,0:23:17.840
that looks pretty good if you wanted to

0:23:16.240,0:23:19.360
do the lower right corner you could

0:23:17.840,0:23:21.120
doesn't really matter

0:23:19.360,0:23:23.120
but we've got a button it looks

0:23:21.120,0:23:25.840
clickable and so we want to add

0:23:23.120,0:23:27.760
code to make it actually be clickable

0:23:25.840,0:23:29.600
and buttons what they typically do

0:23:27.760,0:23:30.799
in their code is they're they're quite

0:23:29.600,0:23:34.080
short

0:23:30.799,0:23:35.440
you have a when the sprite is clicked

0:23:34.080,0:23:37.039
and typically what you want to do is you

0:23:35.440,0:23:38.400
want to tell somebody else that you got

0:23:37.039,0:23:40.320
clicked so what they typically do is

0:23:38.400,0:23:42.159
they just broadcast a message

0:23:40.320,0:23:43.520
so almost every button i've ever made my

0:23:42.159,0:23:44.960
whole life like it consists of like

0:23:43.520,0:23:46.559
these two lines of code

0:23:44.960,0:23:48.240
that's not quite true sometimes it wants

0:23:46.559,0:23:49.760
to do something to itself but usually

0:23:48.240,0:23:51.520
it wants to tell other people so just

0:23:49.760,0:23:54.080
broadcast a message

0:23:51.520,0:23:56.000
i'm gonna make a message here uh called

0:23:54.080,0:23:58.240
uh next

0:23:56.000,0:23:59.919
so whenever i click the next button he's

0:23:58.240,0:24:01.919
just gonna broadcast next

0:23:59.919,0:24:03.440
so he's just gonna tell the whole world

0:24:01.919,0:24:06.159
next right so just

0:24:03.440,0:24:07.840
just a way of letting them know the

0:24:06.159,0:24:10.320
people that are going to have to listen

0:24:07.840,0:24:11.279
uh for this next message are going to be

0:24:10.320,0:24:14.240
the balls

0:24:11.279,0:24:15.520
so the balls so come into the ball it's

0:24:14.240,0:24:18.960
good

0:24:15.520,0:24:20.480
are going to have a win i receive next

0:24:18.960,0:24:22.799
and what i'm going to do to change their

0:24:20.480,0:24:26.400
color again there's many options here

0:24:22.799,0:24:28.559
is i'm just going to say next costume

0:24:26.400,0:24:30.799
and what that'll do is that'll change it

0:24:28.559,0:24:32.559
from the blue to the next color

0:24:30.799,0:24:35.840
and then that color effect will have a

0:24:32.559,0:24:38.159
different impact on that other costume

0:24:35.840,0:24:40.080
and so it hopefully should make all the

0:24:38.159,0:24:41.440
bowls change their colors

0:24:40.080,0:24:42.880
so i'm going to go ahead and stop it and

0:24:41.440,0:24:45.279
run it again here i'm going to say that

0:24:42.880,0:24:46.880
i want nine balls

0:24:45.279,0:24:49.440
and so now i can see that i've got nine

0:24:46.880,0:24:49.919
balls and then when i click on the next

0:24:49.440,0:24:52.880
button

0:24:49.919,0:24:54.400
uh he broadcast to everybody uh next and

0:24:52.880,0:24:54.960
you can see that they all change their

0:24:54.400,0:24:57.120
color

0:24:54.960,0:25:00.000
so it's kind of a way to uh to have

0:24:57.120,0:25:02.240
everybody change their color

0:25:00.000,0:25:04.000
and by the way if you wanted the back to

0:25:02.240,0:25:04.640
not leave a trace the fun thing about

0:25:04.000,0:25:07.279
this code

0:25:04.640,0:25:08.240
is these are all clones so you could

0:25:07.279,0:25:12.559
just take it out

0:25:08.240,0:25:15.039
one time and so i'll do my nine again

0:25:12.559,0:25:16.720
and now uh they all won't draw anything

0:25:15.039,0:25:18.799
when they go back which which

0:25:16.720,0:25:21.840
i like because then i can kind of do uh

0:25:18.799,0:25:23.840
crazy crazy patterns right

0:25:21.840,0:25:26.080
uh cool i think this is pretty good i

0:25:23.840,0:25:27.919
think i might choose to put on a crazy

0:25:26.080,0:25:29.840
backdrop

0:25:27.919,0:25:31.600
there's one that's kind of like goes

0:25:29.840,0:25:33.360
with kaleidoscope yeah raise i think

0:25:31.600,0:25:36.480
raise is cool

0:25:33.360,0:25:37.440
and so now i can do as many as i want so

0:25:36.480,0:25:39.039
i'll do 80

0:25:37.440,0:25:40.400
just to kind of finish things off i

0:25:39.039,0:25:42.159
could start driving while they're

0:25:40.400,0:25:43.919
building that has a neat effect

0:25:42.159,0:25:45.200
but i think that i kind of like the the

0:25:43.919,0:25:47.279
effect here as well

0:25:45.200,0:25:48.720
and then if i click on next all my

0:25:47.279,0:25:51.760
colors will change

0:25:48.720,0:25:53.279
uh click on next again uh you can see

0:25:51.760,0:25:56.640
that you can make make all sorts of

0:25:53.279,0:26:01.360
crazy patterns pretty

0:25:56.640,0:26:01.360
cool pretty fun click on share

0:26:01.679,0:26:07.360
as soon as you click on share it takes

0:26:02.960,0:26:07.360
you to this page and we'll just say

0:26:07.679,0:26:15.440
tell me how many balls you want

0:26:11.520,0:26:17.520
and then use the arrow keys to drive

0:26:15.440,0:26:19.760
i'll put an exclamation point on there

0:26:17.520,0:26:20.640
so super fun project to share with other

0:26:19.760,0:26:21.919

0:27:19.120,0:27:22.640
camp i want to say a couple things uh

0:27:21.039,0:27:25.120
just to wrap up today

0:27:22.640,0:27:26.799
uh so first off uh coding is fun you can

0:27:25.120,0:27:27.679
do this that's our main message that's

0:27:26.799,0:27:29.120
our take home

0:27:27.679,0:27:31.360
uh hopefully you've had that drilled

0:27:29.120,0:27:32.640
into uh over the last one or two weeks

0:27:31.360,0:27:33.360
depending on how long you've been with

0:27:32.640,0:27:35.039
us

0:27:33.360,0:27:36.480
the other thing i'll say is that your

0:27:35.039,0:27:39.200
creativity

0:27:36.480,0:27:39.919
is important is as important for what

0:27:39.200,0:27:41.679
you can make

0:27:39.919,0:27:43.840
as your coding skills so coding skills

0:27:41.679,0:27:45.360
are great but you can really see how

0:27:43.840,0:27:48.240
scratch like

0:27:45.360,0:27:49.679
brings creativity to life so this week

0:27:48.240,0:27:51.279
we did a lot of things together let's

0:27:49.679,0:27:53.279
just kind of review some of them

0:27:51.279,0:27:55.120
we started with the lawn mower we

0:27:53.279,0:27:56.960
learned how to do the math to make a

0:27:55.120,0:27:59.360
grid and put them all up there

0:27:56.960,0:28:01.200
and then we revealed a random backdrop

0:27:59.360,0:28:03.200
which was really neat

0:28:01.200,0:28:05.039
uh day two was the dino jump that's

0:28:03.200,0:28:06.559
where we learned about gravity the guy

0:28:05.039,0:28:09.200
throwing the ball off the roof it starts

0:28:06.559,0:28:11.039
going faster and faster as it gets lower

0:28:09.200,0:28:12.320
we also made that one kind of like a fun

0:28:11.039,0:28:14.640
game to play so that was one of our

0:28:12.320,0:28:17.039
funnest games to play

0:28:14.640,0:28:17.919
the irish sheepdog this one was crazy

0:28:17.039,0:28:20.159
this one we

0:28:17.919,0:28:21.760
created a timer to see how fast you

0:28:20.159,0:28:23.039
could do this task

0:28:21.760,0:28:24.480
i don't know if people played it but

0:28:23.039,0:28:26.080
using the arrow keys to get that dog

0:28:24.480,0:28:27.440
around is kind of hard

0:28:26.080,0:28:29.679
and it's really neat to see if you can

0:28:27.440,0:28:31.440
go faster and faster we also learned

0:28:29.679,0:28:32.399
about a neat concept called pushing

0:28:31.440,0:28:34.080
sprites

0:28:32.399,0:28:35.440
so in order to push a sprite for one

0:28:34.080,0:28:36.799
sprite to push another

0:28:35.440,0:28:39.200
really they just need to have the same

0:28:36.799,0:28:40.399
direction and the same speed

0:28:39.200,0:28:42.880
and then it looks like you're pushing

0:28:40.399,0:28:44.640
that sprite which is really fun

0:28:42.880,0:28:45.919
the hardest day was actually day four i

0:28:44.640,0:28:47.279
told you that it was gonna be day three

0:28:45.919,0:28:47.919
but the hardest day was actually day

0:28:47.279,0:28:50.880
four

0:28:47.919,0:28:52.399
uh we did the slide puzzle we made loops

0:28:50.880,0:28:54.720
uh we made lists

0:28:52.399,0:28:56.640
um we did some advanced things that day

0:28:54.720,0:28:57.679
uh if you got your slide puzzle again

0:28:56.640,0:28:58.960
that's a that's a big

0:28:57.679,0:29:01.520
pat on the back if you got that one

0:28:58.960,0:29:03.120
working uh and then today friday was

0:29:01.520,0:29:05.360
kind of a funner day

0:29:03.120,0:29:07.039
but really we gotta um learn some new

0:29:05.360,0:29:08.000
skills like with user input and that

0:29:07.039,0:29:10.480
color effect

0:29:08.000,0:29:11.600
um and we gotta reinforce uh the things

0:29:10.480,0:29:12.159
that we've been learning throughout this

0:29:11.600,0:29:13.520
camp

0:29:12.159,0:29:17.120
so how many of these different things

0:29:13.520,0:29:17.919
use clones clones clones clones clones

0:29:17.120,0:29:20.320
clones

0:29:17.919,0:29:21.440
lots and lots and lots of clones all

0:29:20.320,0:29:24.559
right so that is

0:29:21.440,0:29:26.799
it uh we loved having you join us

0:29:24.559,0:29:28.640
we have a lot of fun doing this camp we

0:29:26.799,0:29:31.200
hope to do it again next year

0:29:28.640,0:29:32.320
um certainly certainly certainly uh fill

0:29:31.200,0:29:33.600
out that feedback

0:29:32.320,0:29:35.360
