0:00:04.640,0:00:09.360
hey hey welcome to connecting with code

0:00:07.040,0:00:11.360
week two uh we're excited to have you

0:00:09.360,0:00:13.840
here uh we're gonna be using scratch

0:00:11.360,0:00:15.360
again just like we did uh in week one

0:00:13.840,0:00:17.440
um if you didn't see it there was a

0:00:15.360,0:00:17.920
whole week one which was an introductory

0:00:17.440,0:00:20.480
uh

0:00:17.920,0:00:22.400
series of videos that you scratch those

0:00:20.480,0:00:24.960
videos are focused for like a k

0:00:22.400,0:00:26.480
through three audience but to be honest

0:00:24.960,0:00:27.840
they're also for anyone that's never

0:00:26.480,0:00:29.760
coded before

0:00:27.840,0:00:32.000
this week is going to be like more

0:00:29.760,0:00:32.559
intense right so this uh this week is

0:00:32.000,0:00:34.399
for

0:00:32.559,0:00:36.480
fourth through eighth graders if you've

0:00:34.399,0:00:37.440
never coded before um and you're in that

0:00:36.480,0:00:39.200
that age range

0:00:37.440,0:00:41.120
uh then you're uh you're in the right

0:00:39.200,0:00:42.719
place if you're worried about your

0:00:41.120,0:00:44.480
coding you could go back and work a

0:00:42.719,0:00:46.640
couple of those videos from week one

0:00:44.480,0:00:48.960
just to kind of like mention that right

0:00:46.640,0:00:50.079
this series is also appropriate for

0:00:48.960,0:00:51.520
older people as well

0:00:50.079,0:00:53.840
uh people that just want to learn more

0:00:51.520,0:00:55.600
about scratch so what we're gonna do is

0:00:53.840,0:00:57.920
we're gonna build a game today

0:00:55.600,0:00:59.199
uh you're gonna follow along with me and

0:00:57.920,0:01:00.079
we're going to hopefully make some cool

0:00:59.199,0:01:02.000
things

0:01:00.079,0:01:03.359
i want to introduce my campers so i

0:01:02.000,0:01:05.119
brought two campers

0:01:03.359,0:01:06.640
that you might recognize from week one

0:01:05.119,0:01:08.000
love this guy introduce himself first

0:01:06.640,0:01:11.280
what's your name and how old are you

0:01:08.000,0:01:13.600
hello i am keegan fisher and

0:01:11.280,0:01:15.119
nine years old nine years old so he's

0:01:13.600,0:01:15.520
going to be going into fourth so he's

0:01:15.119,0:01:17.680
the

0:01:15.520,0:01:18.799
the age range at the bare minimum that

0:01:17.680,0:01:20.799
makes it in here

0:01:18.799,0:01:23.040
hi my name is mckinley fisher and i'm

0:01:20.799,0:01:24.880
11. cool and what grade are you going

0:01:23.040,0:01:28.080
into next year

0:01:24.880,0:01:30.560
sixth uh so these are uh my two campers

0:01:28.080,0:01:31.759
uh we're kind of on the younger end of

0:01:30.560,0:01:33.920
um

0:01:31.759,0:01:35.920
what this camp is really designed for uh

0:01:33.920,0:01:39.119
but we're gonna make it work right

0:01:35.920,0:01:41.360
so this material um consists of five

0:01:39.119,0:01:42.799
days so there's five different videos

0:01:41.360,0:01:44.560
today we're going to be doing something

0:01:42.799,0:01:47.280
called lawn mower so

0:01:44.560,0:01:48.079
lawnmower is uh today's week one monday

0:01:47.280,0:01:50.159
activity

0:01:48.079,0:01:52.000
uh tuesday is dino jump it's kind of

0:01:50.159,0:01:54.079
like the the no internet game

0:01:52.000,0:01:55.439
if you've ever played that in chrome uh

0:01:54.079,0:01:58.000
irish sheepdog

0:01:55.439,0:01:59.360
is wednesday slide puzzle it's probably

0:01:58.000,0:02:00.640
our biggest game it's going to be on

0:01:59.360,0:02:02.479
thursday

0:02:00.640,0:02:04.079
and then an advanced kaleidoscope so if

0:02:02.479,0:02:06.399
you were with us in week one

0:02:04.079,0:02:07.680
friday we did like an intro kaleidoscope

0:02:06.399,0:02:09.440
and we're going to be doing an advanced

0:02:07.680,0:02:10.959
kaleidoscope this week

0:02:09.440,0:02:13.040
i'd do some acknowledgments before we

0:02:10.959,0:02:13.680
get started this material was developed

0:02:13.040,0:02:16.160
by

0:02:13.680,0:02:16.800
me i'm a professor here at roles holmen

0:02:16.160,0:02:18.959
so this

0:02:16.800,0:02:21.280
camp is brought to you by rolls holmen

0:02:18.959,0:02:23.760
this year we're partnering with

0:02:21.280,0:02:25.680
mission college so this material was

0:02:23.760,0:02:27.200
co-developed by bob shaffer so you won't

0:02:25.680,0:02:28.959
see him on the camera here but we

0:02:27.200,0:02:31.200
developed the material together

0:02:28.959,0:02:32.800
so it's a partnership this year between

0:02:31.200,0:02:35.680
rolls-holman and mission college

0:02:32.800,0:02:36.959
to bring you this camp so let's take a

0:02:35.680,0:02:38.239
look at what we're going to build

0:02:36.959,0:02:39.840
together today

0:02:38.239,0:02:41.599
um so i'm going to start by showing you

0:02:39.840,0:02:42.239
the solution uh it's always kind of nice

0:02:41.599,0:02:44.879
to know

0:02:42.239,0:02:45.920
what our goal is this game is called

0:02:44.879,0:02:47.760
lawn mower

0:02:45.920,0:02:50.319
this is inspired by keegan by the way

0:02:47.760,0:02:52.560
he's the lawn mower in our family

0:02:50.319,0:02:53.680
and so let's go ahead and take a look at

0:02:52.560,0:02:55.599
the solution

0:02:53.680,0:02:57.040
by the way i'll make a link to the

0:02:55.599,0:03:00.879
solution available on the

0:02:57.040,0:03:02.319
website so connectingwithcode.org camp

0:03:00.879,0:03:03.760
and so you can go look at the solution

0:03:02.319,0:03:06.000
there if you want but i'm just going to

0:03:03.760,0:03:08.239
play it and you can watch it

0:03:06.000,0:03:10.080
so you can see that what happens is it

0:03:08.239,0:03:13.200
starts off by

0:03:10.080,0:03:14.640
planting grass and so the whole field

0:03:13.200,0:03:17.200
covered with grass

0:03:14.640,0:03:18.959
and then i'm controlling this mower with

0:03:17.200,0:03:21.840
the the keyboard keys

0:03:18.959,0:03:23.360
and i'm revealing a picture behind it

0:03:21.840,0:03:25.040
now this picture happened to be a fairly

0:03:23.360,0:03:27.360
grassy picture i've got one more to cut

0:03:25.040,0:03:27.360
up here

0:03:28.000,0:03:33.840
that was really loud and so you can see

0:03:31.680,0:03:34.959
that the idea of this game is that you

0:03:33.840,0:03:37.519
click the start button

0:03:34.959,0:03:39.599
uh and it plants all your grass um and

0:03:37.519,0:03:41.120
then it's got a hidden picture behind it

0:03:39.599,0:03:42.239
now sure enough this time it randomly

0:03:41.120,0:03:45.200
picked the same picture

0:03:42.239,0:03:46.879
i'm gonna stop it um and run it again

0:03:45.200,0:03:47.360
and so there's some hidden picture back

0:03:46.879,0:03:48.959
there

0:03:47.360,0:03:50.720
it is randomly picking a picture i

0:03:48.959,0:03:52.159
promise

0:03:50.720,0:03:53.599
all right so there it's finally a

0:03:52.159,0:03:54.879
different one and honestly i don't know

0:03:53.599,0:03:56.159
why it took so long to

0:03:54.879,0:03:58.799
get a different image but the idea of

0:03:56.159,0:04:00.319
this game is that you'll

0:03:58.799,0:04:02.000
make some secret image so you're going

0:04:00.319,0:04:03.439
to make a number of different wallpapers

0:04:02.000,0:04:05.840
to put back there

0:04:03.439,0:04:08.400
and then you're going to lawnmower to

0:04:05.840,0:04:08.400
reveal

0:04:09.599,0:04:13.280
to reveal the solution right i mean each

0:04:12.080,0:04:15.439
time it should be

0:04:13.280,0:04:16.560
different and you can make fun messages

0:04:15.439,0:04:17.840
for people that you think are going to

0:04:16.560,0:04:18.720
play your game so let's say you're going

0:04:17.840,0:04:21.519
to show this

0:04:18.720,0:04:23.120
to your mom moms always like messages

0:04:21.519,0:04:29.840
specific to them

0:04:23.120,0:04:29.840
and so you might say i love you mom

0:04:30.160,0:04:33.040
so that's kind of how the game works uh

0:04:31.840,0:04:35.040
makes sense you guys ready to get

0:04:33.040,0:04:38.400
started

0:04:35.040,0:04:42.000
so normally uh with scratch what we do

0:04:38.400,0:04:43.639
is we go visit scratch.mit.edu so i'm

0:04:42.000,0:04:45.600
just going to type this in

0:04:43.639,0:04:48.560
scratch.mit.edu

0:04:45.600,0:04:50.160
and we typically sign in if you already

0:04:48.560,0:04:52.720
have a sign in with scratch

0:04:50.160,0:04:54.240
then use it if you don't you just have

0:04:52.720,0:04:55.680
to sign in over here so

0:04:54.240,0:04:58.080
if you haven't ever signed in it'll

0:04:55.680,0:05:00.400
probably look like this

0:04:58.080,0:05:01.840
and you'll have to click on join scratch

0:05:00.400,0:05:03.759
if you don't have an account

0:05:01.840,0:05:05.600
if you do have an account click on sign

0:05:03.759,0:05:07.120
in pause the video if you don't have an

0:05:05.600,0:05:09.440
account and make one

0:05:07.120,0:05:11.520
you don't have to validate the email

0:05:09.440,0:05:13.120
address if you don't want

0:05:11.520,0:05:14.960
it'll ask you to validate an email

0:05:13.120,0:05:17.360
address if you can do that go ahead and

0:05:14.960,0:05:19.680
do it but you can't make public products

0:05:17.360,0:05:21.199
until you validate your email address so

0:05:19.680,0:05:22.720
just kind of get that worked out

0:05:21.199,0:05:23.680
now normally what we do in scratch i'm

0:05:22.720,0:05:24.880
just going to kind of show you this

0:05:23.680,0:05:27.840
really quickly

0:05:24.880,0:05:30.000
is we click on create and we just start

0:05:27.840,0:05:31.680
creating a game in scratch

0:05:30.000,0:05:33.360
my hope is that you've probably already

0:05:31.680,0:05:35.199
done something in scratch before this

0:05:33.360,0:05:37.520
camp this is kind of an advanced camp

0:05:35.199,0:05:38.960
but if you haven't it's okay i'm just

0:05:37.520,0:05:40.800
going to quickly tell you about the

0:05:38.960,0:05:42.800
environment

0:05:40.800,0:05:44.160
so the environment is set up in a couple

0:05:42.800,0:05:46.400
different sections

0:05:44.160,0:05:47.360
the section over here is the stage this

0:05:46.400,0:05:50.080
is like where your code

0:05:47.360,0:05:50.880
runs where things happen below the stage

0:05:50.080,0:05:52.479
are the different

0:05:50.880,0:05:54.800
sprites in your game some people call

0:05:52.479,0:05:56.240
them actors so here i've got a cat as an

0:05:54.800,0:05:58.720
actor in my game

0:05:56.240,0:06:00.240
and i can move him around on the stage

0:05:58.720,0:06:02.000
and then the cat has

0:06:00.240,0:06:03.280
code that you can write for the cat

0:06:02.000,0:06:05.039
that's obviously why we're

0:06:03.280,0:06:06.560
using scratch because it involves a lot

0:06:05.039,0:06:08.560
of code it can have

0:06:06.560,0:06:09.759
costumes which are different images for

0:06:08.560,0:06:11.199
the sprites

0:06:09.759,0:06:13.520
and then he can have sounds that he

0:06:11.199,0:06:14.479
knows how to play just to really briefly

0:06:13.520,0:06:18.000
do something let's

0:06:14.479,0:06:20.080
drag over one piece of code

0:06:18.000,0:06:21.759
and to run it you can double click on it

0:06:20.080,0:06:23.280
that's like one way to run it

0:06:21.759,0:06:25.039
it's kind of the worst way to run it but

0:06:23.280,0:06:27.919
it is one way to run it

0:06:25.039,0:06:29.199
you can also go to events here you can

0:06:27.919,0:06:31.199
see that there's a number of different

0:06:29.199,0:06:32.639
code blocks

0:06:31.199,0:06:35.120
and they're color coordinated you can

0:06:32.639,0:06:37.520
either click on these to get around

0:06:35.120,0:06:39.120
or you can scroll through here to find

0:06:37.520,0:06:42.400
it if you go to events

0:06:39.120,0:06:45.120
and grab when green flag clicks that's

0:06:42.400,0:06:47.600
typically how these programs start

0:06:45.120,0:06:50.479
and so now when i click the green flag

0:06:47.600,0:06:53.360
you can see that he goes

0:06:50.479,0:06:55.120
typically your programs will have loops

0:06:53.360,0:06:56.800
so i'm going to just quickly grab a

0:06:55.120,0:06:58.240
forever loop here

0:06:56.800,0:07:00.319
and i'm going to stick it around that

0:06:58.240,0:07:03.680
one you can see that scratch

0:07:00.319,0:07:04.800
is more kid friendly than regular

0:07:03.680,0:07:07.360
program language because you

0:07:04.800,0:07:09.520
you drag and drop the code instead of

0:07:07.360,0:07:11.120
actually like typing it

0:07:09.520,0:07:12.880
and then just to put one more command in

0:07:11.120,0:07:16.560
here i'm going to find one that says

0:07:12.880,0:07:17.840
if on edge balance so right now if i run

0:07:16.560,0:07:20.080
this program you can see that it makes

0:07:17.840,0:07:22.479
my cat go back and forth forever

0:07:20.080,0:07:24.560
that is typically how we start programs

0:07:22.479,0:07:27.280
we start from a blank slate

0:07:24.560,0:07:28.240
we add sprites we add code we build

0:07:27.280,0:07:30.000
things up

0:07:28.240,0:07:31.919
for today's lesson this is a more

0:07:30.000,0:07:32.319
advanced lesson we're going to start

0:07:31.919,0:07:35.919
with

0:07:32.319,0:07:37.840
a starter project so instead of

0:07:35.919,0:07:39.360
making you download the images for like

0:07:37.840,0:07:42.160
the lawnmower and the grass

0:07:39.360,0:07:43.199
i'm going to give you a starting project

0:07:42.160,0:07:45.199
and we're going to learn a

0:07:43.199,0:07:47.199
ton of things today this is just kind of

0:07:45.199,0:07:48.560
a list of the learning objectives for

0:07:47.199,0:07:50.000
today

0:07:48.560,0:07:52.080
learning about the environment we kind

0:07:50.000,0:07:54.000
of just did that learning about flow

0:07:52.080,0:07:56.639
control statements

0:07:54.000,0:07:58.080
learning how to make clones even

0:07:56.639,0:08:00.319
mckinley hasn't made clones she'll be

0:07:58.080,0:08:03.199
excited to learn about clones

0:08:00.319,0:08:04.479
and lots of good stuff with scratch so

0:08:03.199,0:08:05.120
to start things off what you're going to

0:08:04.479,0:08:07.599
need to do

0:08:05.120,0:08:09.360
is you're going to need to remix the

0:08:07.599,0:08:10.080
project that i've got here this project

0:08:09.360,0:08:12.400
is called

0:08:10.080,0:08:14.560
lawnmower starting code so you're going

0:08:12.400,0:08:16.479
to have to go to this url

0:08:14.560,0:08:17.680
this url i'll make it available in the

0:08:16.479,0:08:19.720
email that i send out

0:08:17.680,0:08:21.199
i'll make it available on the

0:08:19.720,0:08:23.680
connectingwithcode.org

0:08:21.199,0:08:25.599
camp page so you can find it there also

0:08:23.680,0:08:27.599
put it in the description of this video

0:08:25.599,0:08:30.240
if all those things fail just type it

0:08:27.599,0:08:32.320
right it's not that hard to type

0:08:30.240,0:08:33.519
when you go to uh so i'm just going to

0:08:32.320,0:08:35.360
go and close this one

0:08:33.519,0:08:37.279
when you go to this page it should look

0:08:35.360,0:08:37.919
like this so to say lawnmower starting

0:08:37.279,0:08:40.320
code

0:08:37.919,0:08:43.200
created by fisher.ds that's me you're

0:08:40.320,0:08:45.200
going to have to click on remix

0:08:43.200,0:08:47.279
now what you happens with remix is it

0:08:45.200,0:08:49.839
makes a copy of this project

0:08:47.279,0:08:50.800
from fischerds and it brings it into

0:08:49.839,0:08:54.000
your account

0:08:50.800,0:08:56.000
so now you have remixed this project

0:08:54.000,0:08:57.600
it also makes the name lawnmower

0:08:56.000,0:08:59.519
starting code remix

0:08:57.600,0:09:01.839
let's go ahead and change that so let's

0:08:59.519,0:09:03.200
just make it lawnmower

0:09:01.839,0:09:04.720
and that's that's a fine name if you

0:09:03.200,0:09:06.160
just want to delete what's there if you

0:09:04.720,0:09:09.120
wanted to type something else you could

0:09:06.160,0:09:11.279
but i'm just going to say a lawnmower

0:09:09.120,0:09:12.560
whenever you get code from someone else

0:09:11.279,0:09:13.839
the first thing you need to do is you

0:09:12.560,0:09:15.200
need to understand

0:09:13.839,0:09:16.320
what you've got so i'm going to go and

0:09:15.200,0:09:18.320
zoom in a little bit here so you can see

0:09:16.320,0:09:20.240
it better

0:09:18.320,0:09:22.000
so what we've got is we've got two

0:09:20.240,0:09:25.680
sprites uh one sprite

0:09:22.000,0:09:26.480
is called robot mower the other sprite

0:09:25.680,0:09:29.360
is called

0:09:26.480,0:09:31.600
grass square you can see that robot

0:09:29.360,0:09:33.279
mower and grass square they have no code

0:09:31.600,0:09:34.880
right so there's no code that we're

0:09:33.279,0:09:36.240
giving you so really we just wanted to

0:09:34.880,0:09:38.160
give you some images

0:09:36.240,0:09:40.880
we've also got a backdrop over here the

0:09:38.160,0:09:42.480
backdrop has no code as well

0:09:40.880,0:09:44.320
and the backdrop you can see has two

0:09:42.480,0:09:46.720
costumes in it uh one

0:09:44.320,0:09:48.320
is called a lawnmower connecting with

0:09:46.720,0:09:50.080
code and then the other is just this

0:09:48.320,0:09:53.600
blank xy grid so we've given you

0:09:50.080,0:09:53.920
two uh two backdrops in here now later

0:09:53.600,0:09:55.360
in

0:09:53.920,0:09:56.959
in today's project you're going to

0:09:55.360,0:09:58.160
create a bunch more backdrops because

0:09:56.959,0:09:59.040
these are going to be like the secret

0:09:58.160,0:10:01.360
backdrops

0:09:59.040,0:10:02.720
that you can reveal you can make two or

0:10:01.360,0:10:04.160
three and that's plenty

0:10:02.720,0:10:05.760
but you can make 10 if you really want

0:10:04.160,0:10:06.560
it and so just know these are the secret

0:10:05.760,0:10:07.839
things

0:10:06.560,0:10:10.399
that kind of make your game fun for

0:10:07.839,0:10:12.480
others for now though go back to the xy

0:10:10.399,0:10:13.839
grid alright so that's the the sprite so

0:10:12.480,0:10:16.959
we've got a mower

0:10:13.839,0:10:19.519
we've got grass we've got backdrops

0:10:16.959,0:10:20.959
and we're ready to to write some code so

0:10:19.519,0:10:22.399
to get started i want you to click on

0:10:20.959,0:10:23.519
the lawnmower

0:10:22.399,0:10:26.160
you know you've got the lawnmower

0:10:23.519,0:10:28.320
selected because his icon shows up here

0:10:26.160,0:10:29.360
and also he's got a blue line around him

0:10:28.320,0:10:31.120
and then

0:10:29.360,0:10:33.440
you could change his costumes or sounds

0:10:31.120,0:10:35.360
but obviously we want the code

0:10:33.440,0:10:37.360
so we've got a couple different goals

0:10:35.360,0:10:39.920
for this game

0:10:37.360,0:10:42.079
our first goal is actually going to

0:10:39.920,0:10:45.120
start with the mower itself

0:10:42.079,0:10:46.880
and so the mower itself needs to move

0:10:45.120,0:10:48.399
so you can see that the mower always

0:10:46.880,0:10:50.480
moves right

0:10:48.399,0:10:52.320
and then what we do is with the left and

0:10:50.480,0:10:54.640
right arrow keys

0:10:52.320,0:10:56.160
we change the direction that the mower

0:10:54.640,0:10:57.839
is going

0:10:56.160,0:10:59.600
and so that's the that's the goal of

0:10:57.839,0:11:02.959
this project

0:10:59.600,0:11:04.880
so the mower let's start with the basics

0:11:02.959,0:11:08.880
let's start with

0:11:04.880,0:11:11.200
events when green flag clicks

0:11:08.880,0:11:12.240
so most projects start this way this is

0:11:11.200,0:11:14.720
kind of like the

0:11:12.240,0:11:16.240
the main function that gets called so

0:11:14.720,0:11:17.839
when the green flag is clicked people

0:11:16.240,0:11:18.959
will expect that's how they start your

0:11:17.839,0:11:20.480
game

0:11:18.959,0:11:21.760
what i want to do when the green flag is

0:11:20.480,0:11:23.760
clicked is i want to make sure that my

0:11:21.760,0:11:26.959
mower always starts in that corner

0:11:23.760,0:11:27.600
so i'm going to go to motion and i'm

0:11:26.959,0:11:31.120
gonna grab

0:11:27.600,0:11:31.839
a go to xy the nice thing about this

0:11:31.120,0:11:33.440
command

0:11:31.839,0:11:35.279
is that it knows where your mower is

0:11:33.440,0:11:36.640
currently at um it's currently at

0:11:35.279,0:11:39.760
negative 200

0:11:36.640,0:11:41.440
uh negative 150 and it's actually just

0:11:39.760,0:11:44.000
going to go to

0:11:41.440,0:11:44.959
negative 200 negative 150. the next

0:11:44.000,0:11:49.920
thing i want to do

0:11:44.959,0:11:53.200
is i want to put on a point in direction

0:11:49.920,0:11:54.880
of 90. so when you run your program now

0:11:53.200,0:11:56.399
it looks like nothing happens

0:11:54.880,0:11:58.800
but if you move your mower somewhere

0:11:56.399,0:12:00.959
different and then run your program

0:11:58.800,0:12:03.600
it's going to snap to that location so

0:12:00.959,0:12:03.600
far so good

0:12:03.839,0:12:07.120
let's see now if we can make this guy

0:12:05.920,0:12:08.800
start to move

0:12:07.120,0:12:10.160
so the movement is going to need to

0:12:08.800,0:12:12.000
happen uh forever

0:12:10.160,0:12:14.240
so the first thing i grab is a forever

0:12:12.000,0:12:15.279
loop i always joke with my younger kids

0:12:14.240,0:12:17.839
that it's uh

0:12:15.279,0:12:19.360
really like improper to tell some human

0:12:17.839,0:12:21.120
to do something forever but in code it

0:12:19.360,0:12:23.360
happens all the time so forever

0:12:21.120,0:12:24.240
uh do this thing and forever what we

0:12:23.360,0:12:27.360
want to do

0:12:24.240,0:12:30.480
is we want to uh move so we're going to

0:12:27.360,0:12:32.399
have move 3 in here

0:12:30.480,0:12:34.480
if you were to run it right now it would

0:12:32.399,0:12:35.920
work fine except for you can't steer

0:12:34.480,0:12:37.200
right so you could run it it would do

0:12:35.920,0:12:38.160
that you could take it back and run it

0:12:37.200,0:12:40.639
again

0:12:38.160,0:12:42.800
so we need to be able to steer using the

0:12:40.639,0:12:45.839
left arrow key and right arrow key

0:12:42.800,0:12:47.600
so we need to know if somebody's

0:12:45.839,0:12:49.600
pressing the left arrow key

0:12:47.600,0:12:50.880
or the right arrow key and i mean you

0:12:49.600,0:12:51.360
kind of heard the command we're going to

0:12:50.880,0:12:54.639
need

0:12:51.360,0:12:58.079
in the words there so go to control

0:12:54.639,0:13:00.079
and find an if statement again if you're

0:12:58.079,0:13:01.839
completely new to coding

0:13:00.079,0:13:03.360
some of these things will seem like a

0:13:01.839,0:13:04.880
flood of information

0:13:03.360,0:13:06.480
but if you've done anything with scratch

0:13:04.880,0:13:07.279
before you've probably seen if

0:13:06.480,0:13:09.360
statements

0:13:07.279,0:13:10.480
the way an if statement works is it says

0:13:09.360,0:13:12.720
if

0:13:10.480,0:13:14.320
this condition is true so this diamond

0:13:12.720,0:13:16.800
means like condition

0:13:14.320,0:13:18.320
then execute the code that's in here and

0:13:16.800,0:13:19.600
currently there's no code in there

0:13:18.320,0:13:22.720
i put two of them on there because i

0:13:19.600,0:13:25.440
know i need a left and a right

0:13:22.720,0:13:26.560
let's do the conditions first conditions

0:13:25.440,0:13:28.399
are very often

0:13:26.560,0:13:30.079
in sensing sometimes they're in

0:13:28.399,0:13:31.760
operators we'll get that later

0:13:30.079,0:13:33.279
and in sensing what we want to do is we

0:13:31.760,0:13:34.959
want to find the right condition you'll

0:13:33.279,0:13:35.440
notice the conditions are the diamonds

0:13:34.959,0:13:37.680
here

0:13:35.440,0:13:38.480
so there's like a touching a touching

0:13:37.680,0:13:40.800
color

0:13:38.480,0:13:42.240
a color touching color all these things

0:13:40.800,0:13:45.600
here's the one we want

0:13:42.240,0:13:47.199
key space pressed so go ahead and drag

0:13:45.600,0:13:48.480
one of these and drop it over

0:13:47.199,0:13:50.560
by the way you know it's going to go in

0:13:48.480,0:13:52.000
there whenever the outline goes white

0:13:50.560,0:13:53.120
right so some people try to like put the

0:13:52.000,0:13:53.839
middle of it in there and it doesn't

0:13:53.120,0:13:55.519
work

0:13:53.839,0:13:57.680
you got to kind of put the edge in there

0:13:55.519,0:13:59.920
and when it goes white you drop it in

0:13:57.680,0:14:01.279
now obviously space is not what we want

0:13:59.920,0:14:02.800
but that's why there's this little drop

0:14:01.279,0:14:03.680
down arrow on here so click the drop

0:14:02.800,0:14:06.720
down arrow

0:14:03.680,0:14:08.399
and change the top one to left arrow uh

0:14:06.720,0:14:11.440
and the bottom one to

0:14:08.399,0:14:13.440
right arrow so when we press the left

0:14:11.440,0:14:14.639
arrow we want to turn a few degrees to

0:14:13.440,0:14:16.880
the left

0:14:14.639,0:14:18.399
and then the opposite with the right

0:14:16.880,0:14:21.680
movement you'll kind of get used to this

0:14:18.399,0:14:25.040
it's going to happen over in motion

0:14:21.680,0:14:27.360
and so in motion a left turn it kind of

0:14:25.040,0:14:31.360
looks like a counterclockwise turn

0:14:27.360,0:14:33.440
so that is the left direction

0:14:31.360,0:14:34.800
and then the right direction is the

0:14:33.440,0:14:37.360
opposite right so

0:14:34.800,0:14:40.800
left and right and the amount that i'm

0:14:37.360,0:14:42.720
going to turn is just 5 and 5.

0:14:40.800,0:14:45.120
and so now if you run your game you

0:14:42.720,0:14:47.920
should be able to use the arrow keys

0:14:45.120,0:14:49.360
to drive your lawnmower around your lawn

0:14:47.920,0:14:50.959
and so it should be

0:14:49.360,0:14:53.120
i don't know a pretty successful little

0:14:50.959,0:14:55.519
fun game

0:14:53.120,0:14:56.720
eventually you will get bored of driving

0:14:55.519,0:14:58.160
your lawnmower around

0:14:56.720,0:15:00.079
because there's nothing to collect or

0:14:58.160,0:15:01.360
nothing to do i could probably drive it

0:15:00.079,0:15:02.399
around for a while but eventually i'd

0:15:01.360,0:15:05.440
get bored

0:15:02.399,0:15:07.199
i can make it do donuts for a while

0:15:05.440,0:15:08.639
so what we need to do is we need this

0:15:07.199,0:15:11.360
lawn mower

0:15:08.639,0:15:12.480
to actually like collect grass right so

0:15:11.360,0:15:13.680
you can see that the first thing that

0:15:12.480,0:15:16.160
happens is the game is

0:15:13.680,0:15:19.120
all the grass gets planted and then the

0:15:16.160,0:15:20.560
lawn mower starts collecting it

0:15:19.120,0:15:22.560
so i think that we're ready to start

0:15:20.560,0:15:24.240
planting some grass

0:15:22.560,0:15:27.440
in order to plant grass if we kind of

0:15:24.240,0:15:31.040
watch it here you can see that it does

0:15:27.440,0:15:32.800
a clone of the sprite called grass

0:15:31.040,0:15:34.720
and it puts it on it does the whole top

0:15:32.800,0:15:35.759
row and then the second row and then the

0:15:34.720,0:15:37.600
third row

0:15:35.759,0:15:39.040
and it does it so fast it's almost like

0:15:37.600,0:15:41.920
magic

0:15:39.040,0:15:42.959
it's not magic you have to code it up to

0:15:41.920,0:15:44.639
make it work

0:15:42.959,0:15:46.720
so what i want to do is i want to start

0:15:44.639,0:15:49.680
with a little bit of math

0:15:46.720,0:15:50.399
because math is going to tell us where

0:15:49.680,0:15:52.880
these

0:15:50.399,0:15:54.079
pieces of grass need to go it's going to

0:15:52.880,0:15:56.240
tell us how many

0:15:54.079,0:15:57.839
are in each row it's going to tell us

0:15:56.240,0:15:59.519
how many columns there are

0:15:57.839,0:16:02.000
and so we need to kind of do some math

0:15:59.519,0:16:03.440
to understand what's going on

0:16:02.000,0:16:04.959
so the first thing that we need to do is

0:16:03.440,0:16:05.759
we need to understand this piece of

0:16:04.959,0:16:08.800
grass

0:16:05.759,0:16:10.560
so how big is this piece of grass

0:16:08.800,0:16:12.639
in here it says it's size 100 that

0:16:10.560,0:16:14.959
doesn't really tell you how big it is

0:16:12.639,0:16:15.680
the costume over here says it's 60 by

0:16:14.959,0:16:17.839
60.

0:16:15.680,0:16:18.800
oh that that actually does tell you how

0:16:17.839,0:16:20.959
big it is

0:16:18.800,0:16:22.480
and in fact if you look at this grid

0:16:20.959,0:16:23.680
this grid shows you how big the whole

0:16:22.480,0:16:26.560
stage is

0:16:23.680,0:16:28.399
and you can see that here's uh 100 here

0:16:26.560,0:16:30.639
and so it's just a little bit more than

0:16:28.399,0:16:32.800
half so it's 60 by 60.

0:16:30.639,0:16:35.120
so that's our first piece of knowledge

0:16:32.800,0:16:36.320
so how big is the tile

0:16:35.120,0:16:38.720
so what we're going to do is we're going

0:16:36.320,0:16:39.440
to go through some slides to kind of do

0:16:38.720,0:16:41.360
the math

0:16:39.440,0:16:42.720
to make sure we understand things and

0:16:41.360,0:16:44.560
then we're going to get started

0:16:42.720,0:16:47.360
in writing the code and i'm going to use

0:16:44.560,0:16:47.360
a white board here

0:16:48.560,0:16:51.920
all right so i got my white board uh and

0:16:50.320,0:16:52.720
now i'm free to draw on things so this

0:16:51.920,0:16:56.240
square

0:16:52.720,0:16:56.639
um we know that it is 60 uh by 60 so

0:16:56.240,0:16:58.480
that's

0:16:56.639,0:17:00.079
that's how big it is we're going to need

0:16:58.480,0:17:02.720
to know some other things

0:17:00.079,0:17:04.079
in addition to the square we're going to

0:17:02.720,0:17:06.880
need to know um how

0:17:04.079,0:17:08.319
big the overall grid is uh and so i'll

0:17:06.880,0:17:11.199
kind of ask my campers

0:17:08.319,0:17:12.559
um how wide do you guys think this grid

0:17:11.199,0:17:14.720
is shut it out if you think you know the

0:17:12.559,0:17:18.400
answer

0:17:14.720,0:17:19.520
240. so 240 was the first guess 240 is a

0:17:18.400,0:17:21.520
very reasonable guess

0:17:19.520,0:17:23.120
i'll say that 240 is almost right but

0:17:21.520,0:17:25.919
it's not quite right

0:17:23.120,0:17:25.919
any other guesses

0:17:26.559,0:17:30.240
so i'll give you a hint this side is

0:17:28.480,0:17:33.520
positive 240.

0:17:30.240,0:17:34.160
that side is negative 240. so how big is

0:17:33.520,0:17:37.840
the whole thing

0:17:34.160,0:17:39.520
480 480 that's right so this grid

0:17:37.840,0:17:42.799
is uh and i just kind of write it up

0:17:39.520,0:17:44.000
here it's 480 pixels wide total

0:17:42.799,0:17:46.000
so that's something that we're going to

0:17:44.000,0:17:48.640
need to know uh let's do the same

0:17:46.000,0:17:51.919
thing uh with the height how tall is

0:17:48.640,0:17:54.880
this grid from top to bottom

0:17:51.919,0:17:54.880
360.

0:17:55.840,0:18:00.559
all right yep 360 uh is correct uh so

0:17:59.039,0:18:02.320
the y is 180

0:18:00.559,0:18:03.919
it goes to a negative 180 oh that's

0:18:02.320,0:18:07.520
really hard to read down there

0:18:03.919,0:18:08.799
and so this thing is 360 tall

0:18:07.520,0:18:10.960
so we're just kind of like gathering

0:18:08.799,0:18:12.799
some information

0:18:10.960,0:18:14.559
so the next question is just so we

0:18:12.799,0:18:17.679
understand it how many

0:18:14.559,0:18:21.520
will fit left to right so this

0:18:17.679,0:18:23.120
square is 60 there's 480 total so

0:18:21.520,0:18:25.440
your division skills are going to get

0:18:23.120,0:18:26.559
tested here so how many squares do we

0:18:25.440,0:18:30.000
think are going to fit

0:18:26.559,0:18:33.120
left to right keegan uh not quite

0:18:30.000,0:18:36.240
[ __ ] so

0:18:33.120,0:18:39.280
so her guess was 80. eight

0:18:36.240,0:18:42.400
eight eight yeah yep no problem so

0:18:39.280,0:18:45.600
our goal um is to fit on here

0:18:42.400,0:18:47.520
eight squares across so if we

0:18:45.600,0:18:50.000
were to kind of like divvy this thing up

0:18:47.520,0:18:52.720
um you know we could divide it here

0:18:50.000,0:18:53.760
and here i rise my marker is not great

0:18:52.720,0:18:56.960
but there's going to be

0:18:53.760,0:18:58.720
eight different um

0:18:56.960,0:19:01.039
squares uh split up in here maybe i'll

0:18:58.720,0:19:04.400
get a better marker here in a little bit

0:19:01.039,0:19:06.160
uh next question how many fits uh top to

0:19:04.400,0:19:07.679
bottom oh shoot i jumped to the wrong

0:19:06.160,0:19:09.360
page i guess i've got the answer here

0:19:07.679,0:19:11.039
how many will fit top to bottom if it's

0:19:09.360,0:19:13.919
360.

0:19:11.039,0:19:14.720
keegan can you read the screen six yeah

0:19:13.919,0:19:17.120
that's right

0:19:14.720,0:19:17.919
so our goal that's a marker um our goal

0:19:17.120,0:19:21.600
is to get

0:19:17.919,0:19:23.280
um eight of them uh across and then six

0:19:21.600,0:19:25.280
of them from top to bottom

0:19:23.280,0:19:28.320
so it looks like there's going to be

0:19:25.280,0:19:31.600
kind of like a a row here a row there

0:19:28.320,0:19:32.880
a row here so our goal is to to make all

0:19:31.600,0:19:34.240
that happen

0:19:32.880,0:19:35.840
now we're going to start putting them in

0:19:34.240,0:19:36.960
one at a time right so we're going to

0:19:35.840,0:19:38.720
start putting them in we're going to put

0:19:36.960,0:19:40.080
in this one first

0:19:38.720,0:19:42.559
and then this one second and then this

0:19:40.080,0:19:45.840
one third fourth fifth

0:19:42.559,0:19:47.200
sixth seventh eighth you get the idea

0:19:45.840,0:19:49.679
i'm not gonna label all these

0:19:47.200,0:19:50.799
how many are we gonna have total what's

0:19:49.679,0:19:51.600
the bottom number here can anybody

0:19:50.799,0:19:53.760
figure out what we're going to have

0:19:51.600,0:19:57.600
total

0:19:53.760,0:19:58.559
48 48 that's correct um and so somehow i

0:19:57.600,0:20:00.880
got off there

0:19:58.559,0:20:02.640
uh that's 15 and 16. so there's going to

0:20:00.880,0:20:04.960
be 48 squares total

0:20:02.640,0:20:05.760
they're going to be set up with 8 in

0:20:04.960,0:20:08.559
each row

0:20:05.760,0:20:10.880
and there's going to be six rows total

0:20:08.559,0:20:14.080
now we've got to do some harder math

0:20:10.880,0:20:15.760
so where does the first one go so in

0:20:14.080,0:20:18.799
scratch what you care about is you

0:20:15.760,0:20:20.240
care about the center of the sprite

0:20:18.799,0:20:22.240
so our first one that we're going to put

0:20:20.240,0:20:25.520
in goes right there

0:20:22.240,0:20:27.120
so this edge has an x value of negative

0:20:25.520,0:20:31.919
240.

0:20:27.120,0:20:35.600
the overall box is 60 wide

0:20:31.919,0:20:37.520
so what is the x value uh right here

0:20:35.600,0:20:39.039
so how much do we have to move over from

0:20:37.520,0:20:43.120
negative 240

0:20:39.039,0:20:45.919
um half of the box and so what value

0:20:43.120,0:20:46.400
in the x is that right there you got it

0:20:45.919,0:20:49.360
all right

0:20:46.400,0:20:52.880
way to go keegan all right so keegan

0:20:49.360,0:20:52.880
just got it studied again for us keegan

0:20:53.600,0:20:56.880
negative 210 right so it just changes

0:20:56.000,0:20:59.600
that uh

0:20:56.880,0:21:01.120
by by 30. so negative 210 that's going

0:20:59.600,0:21:03.840
to be an important number

0:21:01.120,0:21:04.960
so the x center is negative 210 of that

0:21:03.840,0:21:08.159
first tile

0:21:04.960,0:21:11.039
what's the y so the y up here is

0:21:08.159,0:21:11.360
180 at the top and of course we have to

0:21:11.039,0:21:15.679
come

0:21:11.360,0:21:17.919
down by 30. so what is the y value of

0:21:15.679,0:21:20.960
this first dial

0:21:17.919,0:21:22.159
150. 150. since we got this one all

0:21:20.960,0:21:25.120
right so

0:21:22.159,0:21:26.159
um that's our math right so this this

0:21:25.120,0:21:28.320
square right here

0:21:26.159,0:21:29.840
um this slide right here as soon as i

0:21:28.320,0:21:32.000
erase all this junk

0:21:29.840,0:21:33.520
kind of summarizes our math so we're

0:21:32.000,0:21:36.640
going to have a total of

0:21:33.520,0:21:38.400
eight squares coming across

0:21:36.640,0:21:40.159
and we're going to have six squares up

0:21:38.400,0:21:42.559
and down

0:21:40.159,0:21:44.240
and the first one is going to go at

0:21:42.559,0:21:47.120
negative 210

0:21:44.240,0:21:48.559
uh positive 150. so that um is kind of

0:21:47.120,0:21:50.799
our strategy in our plan

0:21:48.559,0:21:51.760
so how do we make that happen um so what

0:21:50.799,0:21:53.360
we're gonna have to do is we're gonna

0:21:51.760,0:21:53.840
have to go back into our code and we're

0:21:53.360,0:21:56.159
gonna make

0:21:53.840,0:21:57.280
clones of the sprite uh and we're gonna

0:21:56.159,0:21:58.559
put the first one there

0:21:57.280,0:22:00.480
and we're going to see if we can get

0:21:58.559,0:22:01.440
that to work and then after we put the

0:22:00.480,0:22:03.520
first one on

0:22:01.440,0:22:04.799
we'll try to put on the whole first row

0:22:03.520,0:22:06.159
and then after we put on the whole first

0:22:04.799,0:22:08.480
row then we'll put on the whole thing

0:22:06.159,0:22:10.640
sound good so let's go back to our code

0:22:08.480,0:22:13.760
all right so let's see if we can

0:22:10.640,0:22:15.440
jump over into our code uh and and make

0:22:13.760,0:22:17.039
this thing work

0:22:15.440,0:22:18.480
so how do we get a square to show up

0:22:17.039,0:22:20.159
there well one way we could

0:22:18.480,0:22:22.240
we could do it is we could just put it

0:22:20.159,0:22:24.400
there right uh so you know we could go

0:22:22.240,0:22:27.760
until it's at the right spot so negative

0:22:24.400,0:22:30.159
210 positive 150

0:22:27.760,0:22:31.440
and then we could like duplicate it and

0:22:30.159,0:22:32.159
make another one and put it in the right

0:22:31.440,0:22:34.320
spot

0:22:32.159,0:22:35.280
that that would totally work um but

0:22:34.320,0:22:37.679
that's not how

0:22:35.280,0:22:38.640
computer scientists work right so if

0:22:37.679,0:22:41.120
you're making

0:22:38.640,0:22:42.400
um you know multiples of something but

0:22:41.120,0:22:43.520
it's really kind of the same thing

0:22:42.400,0:22:45.520
what you want to do is you want to make

0:22:43.520,0:22:47.120
a clone of it and in fact i don't care

0:22:45.520,0:22:48.240
where the original starts at all because

0:22:47.120,0:22:48.960
eventually i'm going to hide the

0:22:48.240,0:22:50.320
original

0:22:48.960,0:22:52.320
so i'm just going to put the original in

0:22:50.320,0:22:54.320
some random spot and what i want to do

0:22:52.320,0:22:56.640
is i want to create clones of it

0:22:54.320,0:22:58.640
and move it to a spot so let's do this

0:22:56.640,0:23:00.240
let's go over to our stage so click on

0:22:58.640,0:23:02.880
the stage here

0:23:00.240,0:23:04.559
go into the code on the stage and what

0:23:02.880,0:23:06.320
the stage is going to do is the stage is

0:23:04.559,0:23:07.520
going to be responsible for planting all

0:23:06.320,0:23:10.240
the grass

0:23:07.520,0:23:13.039
so let's grab a wind green flag clicked

0:23:10.240,0:23:13.039
for the stage

0:23:13.120,0:23:16.480
and what he's going to do is he's going

0:23:14.799,0:23:18.480
to plant grass

0:23:16.480,0:23:19.520
so to plant grass what you want to do is

0:23:18.480,0:23:23.039
you want to say create

0:23:19.520,0:23:25.039
clone of grass square

0:23:23.039,0:23:26.320
so if you were to run this program now

0:23:25.039,0:23:28.720
what it would do is it would create a

0:23:26.320,0:23:31.039
clone of the grass square

0:23:28.720,0:23:32.960
it's very unexciting because the place

0:23:31.039,0:23:34.799
where it created the clone

0:23:32.960,0:23:36.720
was in the same spot as the original

0:23:34.799,0:23:38.720
does that make sense so there's actually

0:23:36.720,0:23:40.799
two of them now there's the original

0:23:38.720,0:23:42.640
and the clone so we need to create a

0:23:40.799,0:23:44.960
graph square somewhere else

0:23:42.640,0:23:47.279
right so let's make some variables so

0:23:44.960,0:23:48.720
you can make variables in scratch

0:23:47.279,0:23:50.799
variables are very powerful in

0:23:48.720,0:23:53.120
programming they let you just save off a

0:23:50.799,0:23:55.039
number so that it's referenced by a name

0:23:53.120,0:23:56.400
click on variables and we're going to

0:23:55.039,0:23:59.039
make two variables

0:23:56.400,0:24:00.320
click on make a variable the first

0:23:59.039,0:24:04.400
variable is going to be called

0:24:00.320,0:24:07.600
grass x so this is the x value

0:24:04.400,0:24:08.400
for the grass and then the next variable

0:24:07.600,0:24:11.520
is going to be called

0:24:08.400,0:24:13.679
grass y so

0:24:11.520,0:24:15.440
grass x and grass y you can probably

0:24:13.679,0:24:17.440
guess what these variables are going to

0:24:15.440,0:24:19.520
get used for

0:24:17.440,0:24:21.840
variables in scratch you can easily

0:24:19.520,0:24:23.919
display them on the screen if you want

0:24:21.840,0:24:25.919
but you don't have to so i'm going to

0:24:23.919,0:24:27.279
click on this checkbox here

0:24:25.919,0:24:28.559
and what that does is that just makes it

0:24:27.279,0:24:29.360
to where it's not displayed on the

0:24:28.559,0:24:31.360
screen

0:24:29.360,0:24:32.640
so no big deal i just i don't i don't

0:24:31.360,0:24:33.919
need it displayed on the screen you

0:24:32.640,0:24:34.640
still have the variable if it's not

0:24:33.919,0:24:36.960
displayed

0:24:34.640,0:24:37.840
um i just don't need the display so

0:24:36.960,0:24:40.159
here's my goal

0:24:37.840,0:24:40.960
before i say clone graphs i'm going to

0:24:40.159,0:24:45.120
set

0:24:40.960,0:24:49.840
the x and the y so i'm going to set

0:24:45.120,0:24:53.200
grass x to negative 210

0:24:49.840,0:24:54.960
and i'm going to set grass y to positive

0:24:53.200,0:24:58.159
150.

0:24:54.960,0:24:59.440
so those variables are going to get used

0:24:58.159,0:25:00.400
they're not used yet they're going to

0:24:59.440,0:25:03.360
get used

0:25:00.400,0:25:04.159
to tell this clone where to go right so

0:25:03.360,0:25:07.200
i'm going to

0:25:04.159,0:25:09.120
create x y and a clone

0:25:07.200,0:25:11.200
now i've got to go into the into the

0:25:09.120,0:25:12.400
grass square to make it actually use

0:25:11.200,0:25:14.799
those variables

0:25:12.400,0:25:16.320
so the stage right now is fine i'm gonna

0:25:14.799,0:25:19.440
move from the stage

0:25:16.320,0:25:21.760
to the grass square you'll notice that

0:25:19.440,0:25:23.440
every sprite has its own code the stage

0:25:21.760,0:25:25.200
has its own code and you can hop around

0:25:23.440,0:25:26.640
between them uh however you want right

0:25:25.200,0:25:27.120
so like our mower has a bunch of things

0:25:26.640,0:25:28.640
done

0:25:27.120,0:25:32.000
our grass square doesn't have anything

0:25:28.640,0:25:35.520
yet let's write our graph square

0:25:32.000,0:25:37.760
so let's go to events normally

0:25:35.520,0:25:39.919
you would use when green flag clicked

0:25:37.760,0:25:41.760
that is not the case for clones

0:25:39.919,0:25:43.679
clones are a little bit different so

0:25:41.760,0:25:44.720
clones you need to scroll down into

0:25:43.679,0:25:48.880
control

0:25:44.720,0:25:50.480
and find when i start as clone

0:25:48.880,0:25:52.000
it's kind of a neat event so whenever i

0:25:50.480,0:25:54.159
start as a clone

0:25:52.000,0:25:56.640
what do i do well the first thing i want

0:25:54.159,0:26:00.320
to do is i want to set my x and y

0:25:56.640,0:26:04.559
using those variables so i go to motion

0:26:00.320,0:26:06.799
i go to set go to xy

0:26:04.559,0:26:08.240
and i don't want to type in a number i

0:26:06.799,0:26:09.679
want to use those variables so i go to

0:26:08.240,0:26:15.039
variable

0:26:09.679,0:26:18.320
and i use grass x and i use grass y

0:26:15.039,0:26:20.640
so now when i run it my backdrop is

0:26:18.320,0:26:22.480
going to set grass x grass y

0:26:20.640,0:26:25.440
it's going to say create clone of graph

0:26:22.480,0:26:28.080
square and glass squares are going to go

0:26:25.440,0:26:30.400
to that position so if i run it now you

0:26:28.080,0:26:33.200
can see that there's now a grass square

0:26:30.400,0:26:34.799
up at the top so pretty exciting i know

0:26:33.200,0:26:36.400
right

0:26:34.799,0:26:38.000
now something that happens a lot with

0:26:36.400,0:26:40.799
clones is

0:26:38.000,0:26:41.840
we don't actually want the original and

0:26:40.799,0:26:44.320
so the original

0:26:41.840,0:26:45.679
actually we want to hide it all together

0:26:44.320,0:26:46.799
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:26:45.679,0:26:49.440
hide the original

0:26:46.799,0:26:50.799
you can do this in code if you wanted

0:26:49.440,0:26:52.400
but actually it's easier you can

0:26:50.799,0:26:56.559
actually just click on this little like

0:26:52.400,0:26:59.039
no eyeball button and now it's hidden

0:26:56.559,0:27:00.320
that worked but now your clone is also

0:26:59.039,0:27:02.799
hidden so now we've got to show

0:27:00.320,0:27:04.720
our clone does that make sense so for

0:27:02.799,0:27:05.600
the when i start as clone i want it to

0:27:04.720,0:27:09.360
show

0:27:05.600,0:27:10.640
show is in looks um and i scroll down to

0:27:09.360,0:27:12.880
show

0:27:10.640,0:27:13.679
and i'm going to put it after the go to

0:27:12.880,0:27:15.440
xy

0:27:13.679,0:27:17.120
i could put it before it wouldn't really

0:27:15.440,0:27:18.240
matter there's just some chance you'd

0:27:17.120,0:27:20.399
see it move

0:27:18.240,0:27:22.159
but i don't think you'd even see it so

0:27:20.399,0:27:25.200
now if i run it you can see that my

0:27:22.159,0:27:27.200
uh grass square starts up there

0:27:25.200,0:27:29.440
so we have successfully created one

0:27:27.200,0:27:30.159
grass square um if you go up and try to

0:27:29.440,0:27:32.159
mow it

0:27:30.159,0:27:33.679
nothing's gonna happen right so like uh

0:27:32.159,0:27:34.240
it looks like the mower goes under it

0:27:33.679,0:27:36.640
even

0:27:34.240,0:27:38.080
um and it's not surprising that nothing

0:27:36.640,0:27:39.360
happens because we haven't like made

0:27:38.080,0:27:42.640
anything happen

0:27:39.360,0:27:45.840
but we've got a cool setup now

0:27:42.640,0:27:47.600
so now uh let's go back to the backdrop

0:27:45.840,0:27:49.520
so if we wanted to make another graph

0:27:47.600,0:27:52.960
square

0:27:49.520,0:27:54.640
i could um duplicate it you can do this

0:27:52.960,0:27:55.200
too just to prove that it works uh but

0:27:54.640,0:27:56.399
we're

0:27:55.200,0:27:58.799
this is not going to be our final

0:27:56.399,0:28:01.600
solution we could just march over to the

0:27:58.799,0:28:05.840
next spot so if it was at

0:28:01.600,0:28:08.880
negative 210 and we need to move over 60

0:28:05.840,0:28:10.880
what's 260 sorry

0:28:08.880,0:28:14.000
what's 60 moved over [ __ ] do you know

0:28:10.880,0:28:16.080
that one so negative 210

0:28:14.000,0:28:17.760
we're going to add 60 to it and go over

0:28:16.080,0:28:21.039
here so it's negative 210

0:28:17.760,0:28:22.480
plus 60. negative 150 negative 150

0:28:21.039,0:28:25.520
that's right

0:28:22.480,0:28:29.279
so i could do this um and it would make

0:28:25.520,0:28:30.960
two squares now there's a glitch right

0:28:29.279,0:28:32.799
you're like wait a minute dr fisher you

0:28:30.960,0:28:35.120
just said that this was gonna work

0:28:32.799,0:28:36.240
um here's here's the deal this is this

0:28:35.120,0:28:38.880
is what's called a bug

0:28:36.240,0:28:40.320
right um it actually is so fast that it

0:28:38.880,0:28:41.760
makes this one

0:28:40.320,0:28:43.440
and it says hey start making this and

0:28:41.760,0:28:44.159
then it starts making this one and they

0:28:43.440,0:28:46.320
actually both

0:28:44.159,0:28:47.520
got set to the second coordinate so to

0:28:46.320,0:28:50.080
fix this bug

0:28:47.520,0:28:51.760
sometimes that happens we need a very

0:28:50.080,0:28:53.760
very short time delay

0:28:51.760,0:28:55.919
after we make a clone so i'm going to go

0:28:53.760,0:28:58.640
into control

0:28:55.919,0:29:00.480
i'm going to grab weights and i'm going

0:28:58.640,0:29:04.240
to make it very very short

0:29:00.480,0:29:07.039
so i'm going to do like 0.01

0:29:04.240,0:29:08.399
so very very short delay all right by

0:29:07.039,0:29:09.919
the way i just went and helped keegan

0:29:08.399,0:29:12.320
with a problem he had a problem where he

0:29:09.919,0:29:15.600
was accidentally setting grass x

0:29:12.320,0:29:16.159
twice instead of x and y code you'll

0:29:15.600,0:29:18.799
find

0:29:16.159,0:29:19.919
is very very good at doing what you tell

0:29:18.799,0:29:21.440
it to do

0:29:19.919,0:29:22.960
and you have to make sure that you tell

0:29:21.440,0:29:26.640
it to do the right things right

0:29:22.960,0:29:27.760
so x y x y so this worked fine

0:29:26.640,0:29:29.120
by the way you'll notice i didn't

0:29:27.760,0:29:31.279
actually need to wait at the end because

0:29:29.120,0:29:33.840
it because it was done

0:29:31.279,0:29:34.960
all right so now our goal is to make a

0:29:33.840,0:29:37.760
whole row of them

0:29:34.960,0:29:39.200
right um and we could obviously keep

0:29:37.760,0:29:40.000
duplicating this but eventually we would

0:29:39.200,0:29:42.080
have 48

0:29:40.000,0:29:43.760
of these things right so we don't really

0:29:42.080,0:29:46.159
want to do that so what we want to do is

0:29:43.760,0:29:48.240
we want to make a row

0:29:46.159,0:29:50.080
because i like to teach you things we're

0:29:48.240,0:29:52.640
going to also teach you about a function

0:29:50.080,0:29:55.039
so we're going to make a function which

0:29:52.640,0:29:58.159
we can call um and we'll just call

0:29:55.039,0:30:00.159
make a row and it'll just do it so to

0:29:58.159,0:30:03.520
to make a function it's in scratch it's

0:30:00.159,0:30:07.200
called a block so go to my blocks

0:30:03.520,0:30:07.200
click on make a block

0:30:07.279,0:30:12.080
and we'll make this function um we'll

0:30:10.240,0:30:15.600
call it plant

0:30:12.080,0:30:16.960
uh row so just plant row so it's kind of

0:30:15.600,0:30:18.320
like a verb like plant

0:30:16.960,0:30:21.840
um and then the thing that you're going

0:30:18.320,0:30:24.320
to plant is a is a whole row

0:30:21.840,0:30:25.919
plant row is our function and so our

0:30:24.320,0:30:27.520
goal is that we're going to use some of

0:30:25.919,0:30:31.039
this code over here

0:30:27.520,0:30:33.600
inside of our function to make it work

0:30:31.039,0:30:34.799
so um let's go ahead and figure out what

0:30:33.600,0:30:35.840
code needs to go

0:30:34.799,0:30:38.000
into the function so i kind of

0:30:35.840,0:30:39.440
disconnected it over here by the way to

0:30:38.000,0:30:41.919
to call the function

0:30:39.440,0:30:42.720
you'll just say when the green flag is

0:30:41.919,0:30:46.159
pressed

0:30:42.720,0:30:48.480
plant a row so a row is is only about

0:30:46.159,0:30:49.600
x's right so really what i want to do is

0:30:48.480,0:30:52.559
i want to put

0:30:49.600,0:30:53.120
things about x's over here so the the

0:30:52.559,0:30:56.720
grass

0:30:53.120,0:31:00.480
x i want to put it over here the grass

0:30:56.720,0:31:01.679
y however i want to like set before i

0:31:00.480,0:31:04.320
plant the row so

0:31:01.679,0:31:05.360
grass y says like what height should i

0:31:04.320,0:31:10.000
plant this row at

0:31:05.360,0:31:10.000
so i'm saying at 150 plant a row

0:31:10.080,0:31:14.159
and so to plant a row what we really

0:31:11.919,0:31:18.559
want to do is we want to make a loop

0:31:14.159,0:31:20.640
so loops are in control does anybody

0:31:18.559,0:31:22.159
remember how many grass squares we have

0:31:20.640,0:31:23.600
in a single row how many do we put

0:31:22.159,0:31:25.840
across

0:31:23.600,0:31:27.360
eight that's right so i'm going to grab

0:31:25.840,0:31:31.440
a repeat

0:31:27.360,0:31:34.399
of eight um and what i want to do

0:31:31.440,0:31:36.799
is i want to create a clone of the grass

0:31:34.399,0:31:39.120
square

0:31:36.799,0:31:40.640
and then to fix that little bug i want

0:31:39.120,0:31:43.120
to wait for a second so

0:31:40.640,0:31:44.320
i'm going to set the x to the starting

0:31:43.120,0:31:46.559
value

0:31:44.320,0:31:47.760
i'm going to plant a grass i'm going to

0:31:46.559,0:31:49.519
wait this long

0:31:47.760,0:31:51.039
and then after i plant that grass i'm

0:31:49.519,0:31:52.880
going to change the x

0:31:51.039,0:31:55.200
by some amount so i'm going to scoot it

0:31:52.880,0:31:58.880
over before the next one is planted

0:31:55.200,0:32:00.640
so go into variables and we want to

0:31:58.880,0:32:03.679
change

0:32:00.640,0:32:06.240
the x uh by some amount

0:32:03.679,0:32:06.960
um any guesses as to what the amount's

0:32:06.240,0:32:11.039
going to be

0:32:06.960,0:32:11.039
30. so the first guess is 30.

0:32:11.120,0:32:15.679
you said 30 so i'm going to try 30 first

0:32:13.760,0:32:17.919
so if i run it now

0:32:15.679,0:32:20.799
it planted them only 30 apart yeah so we

0:32:17.919,0:32:23.840
want we want 60.

0:32:20.799,0:32:26.000
so this is kind of fun so we can um

0:32:23.840,0:32:29.840
tell the y where it's at and then we can

0:32:26.000,0:32:31.120
call plant row now we could

0:32:29.840,0:32:32.720
this is again i'm just kind of like

0:32:31.120,0:32:33.120
showing you something you could do we

0:32:32.720,0:32:35.840
could

0:32:33.120,0:32:37.519
change the y to a new value and call

0:32:35.840,0:32:39.840
plant row again

0:32:37.519,0:32:41.640
so i'm going to bring the y down by 60.

0:32:39.840,0:32:45.760
so keegan this is your math problem

0:32:41.640,0:32:48.960
150 minus 60.

0:32:45.760,0:32:51.279
90. 90. that's right so

0:32:48.960,0:32:53.200
90. so you can see that right now i'm

0:32:51.279,0:32:55.519
planting a row at 150

0:32:53.200,0:32:57.679
and then i'm planting a row at 90. now

0:32:55.519,0:32:58.000
to be honest this wouldn't be too bad to

0:32:57.679,0:32:59.760
do

0:32:58.000,0:33:01.840
there's only six of them coming this

0:32:59.760,0:33:03.440
wouldn't be too bad to just repeat

0:33:01.840,0:33:05.279
but we're computer scientists right

0:33:03.440,0:33:08.480
that's not how computer scientists roll

0:33:05.279,0:33:09.840
we make loops right um so how many rows

0:33:08.480,0:33:11.840
are their total anybody want to say what

0:33:09.840,0:33:13.919
that number is

0:33:11.840,0:33:16.559
six six yep so we're going to grab a

0:33:13.919,0:33:18.399
repeat six

0:33:16.559,0:33:20.720
um and what we're going to do is we're

0:33:18.399,0:33:23.039
going to plant a row

0:33:20.720,0:33:24.799
um at a given y so i'll tell you what

0:33:23.039,0:33:27.840
i'm going to clean up some things here

0:33:24.799,0:33:29.440
so we're going to set the y to be 150

0:33:27.840,0:33:30.000
that's where we decided that we'd start

0:33:29.440,0:33:31.919
at the top

0:33:30.000,0:33:34.000
if you remember our our math over here

0:33:31.919,0:33:35.600
that's the first one

0:33:34.000,0:33:37.679
um and then we're going to plant a row

0:33:35.600,0:33:38.720
there and then we're going to change the

0:33:37.679,0:33:40.559
y

0:33:38.720,0:33:41.840
um and repeat it six times so take a

0:33:40.559,0:33:44.320
minute

0:33:41.840,0:33:45.600
um and see if you can finish uh finish

0:33:44.320,0:33:48.320
the thing that's missing here

0:33:45.600,0:33:49.519
so we're setting it to 150 and then

0:33:48.320,0:33:51.039
we're going to repeat something six

0:33:49.519,0:33:53.679
times we're planting a row

0:33:51.039,0:33:55.679
but after we plant the first row we want

0:33:53.679,0:33:56.880
to we want to change the y by some

0:33:55.679,0:33:58.399
amount

0:33:56.880,0:34:00.000
see if you can figure out what it is uh

0:33:58.399,0:34:03.200
play with it and see if you can get the

0:34:00.000,0:34:03.200
whole field to show up

0:34:03.919,0:34:08.159
all right so for my campers uh mckinley

0:34:06.399,0:34:09.760
uh knocked it out and keegan says

0:34:08.159,0:34:11.599
um there's a lot of code and you're

0:34:09.760,0:34:13.200
going really fast right um

0:34:11.599,0:34:15.520
you're maybe somewhere in the middle so

0:34:13.200,0:34:16.879
the y of 150 plants a row here

0:34:15.520,0:34:19.599
and what i want to do is i want to go

0:34:16.879,0:34:22.639
into variables and i then want to after

0:34:19.599,0:34:26.480
i plant a row i want to change the y

0:34:22.639,0:34:28.960
um and i want to bring it down uh by 60.

0:34:26.480,0:34:30.639
now um in the y if we want to come down

0:34:28.960,0:34:32.560
it's currently 150.

0:34:30.639,0:34:35.119
we want to come down 60 that's a

0:34:32.560,0:34:36.960
negative 60.

0:34:35.119,0:34:39.440
so you can kind of see how i suppose

0:34:36.960,0:34:42.399
that see if it works with loops

0:34:39.440,0:34:44.079
you can make your code much shorter than

0:34:42.399,0:34:46.159
if you had written the whole thing

0:34:44.079,0:34:47.599
so now you can see that it plants the

0:34:46.159,0:34:50.800
row by row

0:34:47.599,0:34:52.560
all the grass squares now it did plant

0:34:50.800,0:34:55.440
it right on top of my lawn mower

0:34:52.560,0:34:56.879
uh which i guess is a feature eventually

0:34:55.440,0:34:58.240
the lawnmower is going to going to cut

0:34:56.879,0:35:00.400
the grass

0:34:58.240,0:35:02.400
now one thing that i don't like is see

0:35:00.400,0:35:04.000
how my lawnmower is like mowing while

0:35:02.400,0:35:06.880
the grass is being planted

0:35:04.000,0:35:07.839
i actually don't like that i want the

0:35:06.880,0:35:09.920
lawnmower

0:35:07.839,0:35:11.839
to just be hidden while the grass is

0:35:09.920,0:35:13.119
planted it'll actually make my computer

0:35:11.839,0:35:15.440
faster too right

0:35:13.119,0:35:17.680
so here's what i want to do after i

0:35:15.440,0:35:20.400
finish planting all the grass

0:35:17.680,0:35:22.320
i want to broadcast an event that says

0:35:20.400,0:35:23.920
i'm done planting the grass right so

0:35:22.320,0:35:25.599
this is how one sprite

0:35:23.920,0:35:27.359
can communicate with another you

0:35:25.599,0:35:28.560
broadcast an event and a broadcast event

0:35:27.359,0:35:28.960
it's kind of like screaming a message

0:35:28.560,0:35:31.920
like

0:35:28.960,0:35:33.599
i'm done right so real loud so go into

0:35:31.920,0:35:36.320
events

0:35:33.599,0:35:37.520
and find where it says broadcast message

0:35:36.320,0:35:39.359
one

0:35:37.520,0:35:41.359
and put it down here at the bottom so

0:35:39.359,0:35:42.560
it's making all the rows and then when

0:35:41.359,0:35:43.200
it's done it's going to broadcast

0:35:42.560,0:35:44.480
something

0:35:43.200,0:35:47.040
right now it's going to broadcast

0:35:44.480,0:35:50.480
message one that's not a very good name

0:35:47.040,0:35:54.400
let's let's call it like done

0:35:50.480,0:35:56.240
planting right so you can

0:35:54.400,0:35:58.560
write the word done planting any way you

0:35:56.240,0:35:59.920
want you could say done

0:35:58.560,0:36:03.359
and planting you could you could say it

0:35:59.920,0:36:06.400
like that i choose

0:36:03.359,0:36:09.440
to name my variables my messages

0:36:06.400,0:36:10.400
my anything using a style that computer

0:36:09.440,0:36:12.480
programmers use

0:36:10.400,0:36:15.200
it's what's called camel case and so

0:36:12.480,0:36:17.440
things start with a lowercase variable

0:36:15.200,0:36:18.800
and then there's no spaces between words

0:36:17.440,0:36:20.400
you just use a capital

0:36:18.800,0:36:22.000
to indicate that a new word started so

0:36:20.400,0:36:23.359
done planting there's

0:36:22.000,0:36:24.720
nothing special about that i'm just

0:36:23.359,0:36:26.160
showing you cool things that computer

0:36:24.720,0:36:29.280
scientists do right

0:36:26.160,0:36:32.000
so i broadcast done planting and then

0:36:29.280,0:36:34.079
over here in the lawn mower

0:36:32.000,0:36:35.920
you can see that he does a lot of things

0:36:34.079,0:36:37.920
when the green flag is clicked

0:36:35.920,0:36:39.359
here's what i'm going to do i'm going to

0:36:37.920,0:36:41.839
say

0:36:39.359,0:36:43.920
when i receive done planting so all this

0:36:41.839,0:36:45.599
stuff

0:36:43.920,0:36:46.960
can happen when he receives done

0:36:45.599,0:36:50.000
planting

0:36:46.960,0:36:51.760
so i can move him over here in fact if i

0:36:50.000,0:36:53.200
want to i could go a step farther so you

0:36:51.760,0:36:54.400
could run him now and he'll just kind of

0:36:53.200,0:36:57.040
be stationary

0:36:54.400,0:36:58.400
until it's done planting if you wanted

0:36:57.040,0:37:01.200
to you could go one step farther you

0:36:58.400,0:37:03.280
could go into looks

0:37:01.200,0:37:05.440
and you could hide him when the green

0:37:03.280,0:37:08.240
flag is clicked

0:37:05.440,0:37:09.119
and then show him only when he's ready

0:37:08.240,0:37:11.520
to start moving

0:37:09.119,0:37:13.839
right i personally choose to put the

0:37:11.520,0:37:15.440
show after his x and y have been set

0:37:13.839,0:37:17.119
just so there's no chance of like seeing

0:37:15.440,0:37:18.480
him in two places

0:37:17.119,0:37:21.119
but now if you run it you can see he's

0:37:18.480,0:37:24.560
just not there and then he

0:37:21.119,0:37:25.200
starts moving um once all the grass is

0:37:24.560,0:37:27.280
done

0:37:25.200,0:37:28.880
now you can't see him moving because

0:37:27.280,0:37:30.320
he's underneath my grass

0:37:28.880,0:37:32.240
i'm kind of surprised that he's

0:37:30.320,0:37:33.839
underneath my grass but it'll it'll be

0:37:32.240,0:37:36.400
fine

0:37:33.839,0:37:38.160
so things are going really really well

0:37:36.400,0:37:40.320
by the way

0:37:38.160,0:37:43.280
in coding you should always remember to

0:37:40.320,0:37:44.079
save but scratch does save automatically

0:37:43.280,0:37:45.839
for you

0:37:44.079,0:37:47.520
if you ever want to save though you can

0:37:45.839,0:37:50.960
click on file

0:37:47.520,0:37:53.839
save now and it'll save it for you so

0:37:50.960,0:37:54.320
we're doing great the question is what

0:37:53.839,0:37:57.440
now

0:37:54.320,0:38:00.160
right so right now

0:37:57.440,0:38:01.760
um when the lawnmower goes he's

0:38:00.160,0:38:04.160
underneath the grass

0:38:01.760,0:38:05.839
but you can see in the real game when he

0:38:04.160,0:38:08.640
touches a grass square

0:38:05.839,0:38:10.240
it should go away so whenever you're

0:38:08.640,0:38:12.240
coding you have to figure out whose

0:38:10.240,0:38:14.160
responsibility is that so who's

0:38:12.240,0:38:16.400
responsible

0:38:14.160,0:38:18.400
for detecting when the grass is touching

0:38:16.400,0:38:22.079
the mower

0:38:18.400,0:38:24.560
oh that scared me who's responsible for

0:38:22.079,0:38:25.280
detecting uh when the grass is touching

0:38:24.560,0:38:28.480
the mower

0:38:25.280,0:38:31.200
and then making it disappear you could

0:38:28.480,0:38:33.520
put that responsibility on either side

0:38:31.200,0:38:35.520
but since it's the grass the tiding

0:38:33.520,0:38:36.960
i'm going to put that responsibility on

0:38:35.520,0:38:40.000
the grass right

0:38:36.960,0:38:41.760
so let's go to the grass so right now

0:38:40.000,0:38:43.200
the grass isn't doing anything the grass

0:38:41.760,0:38:44.720
just shows up and then it just sits

0:38:43.200,0:38:47.280
there like this

0:38:44.720,0:38:49.280
and so really what the grass needs to do

0:38:47.280,0:38:51.200
is the grass needs to detect

0:38:49.280,0:38:52.480
if it's touching the mower and if it's

0:38:51.200,0:38:55.359
touching the mower

0:38:52.480,0:38:55.839
then it needs to hide right so let's go

0:38:55.359,0:38:59.599
uh

0:38:55.839,0:39:00.000
to control one mistake that people do

0:38:59.599,0:39:02.320
all the

0:39:00.000,0:39:03.599
time is they stick an if statement

0:39:02.320,0:39:06.320
straight on the bottom here

0:39:03.599,0:39:07.599
um that would be pointless um and the

0:39:06.320,0:39:09.280
reason it would be pointless

0:39:07.599,0:39:11.119
is because it would literally check it

0:39:09.280,0:39:14.000
one time when the program runs

0:39:11.119,0:39:15.359
and then never again we want to forever

0:39:14.000,0:39:17.440
check for that so i'm going to grab a

0:39:15.359,0:39:18.640
forever loop first

0:39:17.440,0:39:20.079
and then i'm going to put an if

0:39:18.640,0:39:21.359
statement inside of that so i want to

0:39:20.079,0:39:24.480
forever

0:39:21.359,0:39:25.920
check if i'm touching the mower

0:39:24.480,0:39:27.760
and if i am touching the mower then i

0:39:25.920,0:39:29.839
want to do stuff right

0:39:27.760,0:39:31.760
and so how do i detect if i'm touching

0:39:29.839,0:39:34.800
the mower it's one of these conditions

0:39:31.760,0:39:35.760
it's in sensing and the one that you

0:39:34.800,0:39:37.760
want is actually

0:39:35.760,0:39:40.400
touching mouse pointer which is kind of

0:39:37.760,0:39:42.640
crazy but it's got a drop down arrow

0:39:40.400,0:39:44.800
and so we want to say if i'm touching

0:39:42.640,0:39:48.240
the robot mower

0:39:44.800,0:39:50.160
so now the grass it's his responsibility

0:39:48.240,0:39:51.599
to check if he's touching the robot

0:39:50.160,0:39:54.800
mower if he

0:39:51.599,0:39:57.119
is touching the robot mower we want to

0:39:54.800,0:39:58.960
score point basically so that we can

0:39:57.119,0:40:01.520
keep track of how much has been mowed

0:39:58.960,0:40:02.800
and we also want to go away so those are

0:40:01.520,0:40:05.839
the two things we want to do

0:40:02.800,0:40:07.200
let's go ahead and score a point first

0:40:05.839,0:40:10.400
so to score a point we're going to need

0:40:07.200,0:40:13.920
a variable so i clicked on variables

0:40:10.400,0:40:16.079
make a variable and so you can name this

0:40:13.920,0:40:19.280
variable whatever you want

0:40:16.079,0:40:22.319
um i'm going to call mine grass cuts

0:40:19.280,0:40:24.319
you could call it num grass cut

0:40:22.319,0:40:26.640
whatever whatever you want to do this

0:40:24.319,0:40:27.839
variable you'll notice that i chose to

0:40:26.640,0:40:30.079
name differently

0:40:27.839,0:40:31.520
and that's because it will be visible uh

0:40:30.079,0:40:34.079
like like on my screen

0:40:31.520,0:40:36.079
so if it is visible uh then i try to

0:40:34.079,0:40:37.520
make it like human readable right so num

0:40:36.079,0:40:40.240
grass cut

0:40:37.520,0:40:42.079
so it's going to show up up here i could

0:40:40.240,0:40:44.720
hide it if i wanted but actually for now

0:40:42.079,0:40:46.000
i'm going to make it visible

0:40:44.720,0:40:47.359
all right so whenever you make a

0:40:46.000,0:40:48.079
variable there's a couple things you

0:40:47.359,0:40:51.599
have to do

0:40:48.079,0:40:52.640
you have to create it so i've created it

0:40:51.599,0:40:55.119
here

0:40:52.640,0:40:57.520
you have to set it to zero somewhere or

0:40:55.119,0:41:00.160
set it to some initial value somewhere

0:40:57.520,0:41:01.119
and then you also have to increment it

0:41:00.160,0:41:02.400
really quick

0:41:01.119,0:41:04.720
i'm going to come back to this code i'm

0:41:02.400,0:41:09.119
going to go into the backdrop

0:41:04.720,0:41:13.280
and i'm going to grab a set

0:41:09.119,0:41:15.200
num grass cuts to zero over here now

0:41:13.280,0:41:17.040
i could have reset this variable in a

0:41:15.200,0:41:18.560
couple of different places um i chose to

0:41:17.040,0:41:21.599
do it over on the stage so

0:41:18.560,0:41:23.119
i start off saying num grass cuts zero

0:41:21.599,0:41:25.200
uh on on the stage i think that makes

0:41:23.119,0:41:26.240
the most sense and then we've got to

0:41:25.200,0:41:28.319
increment it

0:41:26.240,0:41:29.760
so now i hop back over you can see i hop

0:41:28.319,0:41:32.839
between code all the time

0:41:29.760,0:41:34.480
hop back over to my graphs and i'm gonna

0:41:32.839,0:41:37.599
change

0:41:34.480,0:41:38.560
numb grass cut by one and so it's going

0:41:37.599,0:41:40.880
to increment

0:41:38.560,0:41:42.000
how much grass i cut the other thing i

0:41:40.880,0:41:45.359
want to do is i want to

0:41:42.000,0:41:46.560
hide this piece of grass

0:41:45.359,0:41:49.040
what i'm going to actually do instead of

0:41:46.560,0:41:52.240
just hiding it i'm going to delete it

0:41:49.040,0:41:55.839
go into control and find

0:41:52.240,0:41:57.760
delete this clone so you can see that

0:41:55.839,0:41:59.760
when i start as clone

0:41:57.760,0:42:01.040
i do all these things and if i touch the

0:41:59.760,0:42:03.920
lawnmower

0:42:01.040,0:42:05.599
then i delete myself so now for the

0:42:03.920,0:42:06.720
first time ever we should be deleting

0:42:05.599,0:42:09.200
grass right

0:42:06.720,0:42:10.480
so if i hit the green flag i can now

0:42:09.200,0:42:13.680
like mow the lawn

0:42:10.480,0:42:16.240
which is cool things are going

0:42:13.680,0:42:17.119
really really well so the next thing i

0:42:16.240,0:42:20.079
want to do

0:42:17.119,0:42:22.800
is i want to change the background image

0:42:20.079,0:42:25.359
so you can see that right now i'm mowing

0:42:22.800,0:42:26.079
and my user is not at all surprised or

0:42:25.359,0:42:27.680
delighted

0:42:26.079,0:42:29.200
because the background image is just

0:42:27.680,0:42:31.440
always this grid right

0:42:29.200,0:42:32.880
if i run it again it's still just the

0:42:31.440,0:42:34.880
grid

0:42:32.880,0:42:36.240
also you'll notice that nothing happens

0:42:34.880,0:42:38.640
when the game wins it was playing that

0:42:36.240,0:42:42.000
super loud sound for me earlier

0:42:38.640,0:42:45.280
so we want to create some backdrops

0:42:42.000,0:42:46.800
that will surprise and delight our user

0:42:45.280,0:42:48.560
so here's what we want to do go into

0:42:46.800,0:42:49.760
backdrops

0:42:48.560,0:42:51.680
the first thing i want to do is i want

0:42:49.760,0:42:53.599
to create a few different backdrops so

0:42:51.680,0:42:55.839
go into backdrops

0:42:53.599,0:42:57.680
you can see that right now there's one

0:42:55.839,0:42:58.400
it's called lawnmower connecting with

0:42:57.680,0:42:59.920
code

0:42:58.400,0:43:02.079
so this is one of the things that we

0:42:59.920,0:43:04.480
might put in there's the secret backdrop

0:43:02.079,0:43:05.839
but we can put more on here as well so

0:43:04.480,0:43:07.680
do this for me

0:43:05.839,0:43:11.440
in the lower left where it says choose

0:43:07.680,0:43:14.480
backdrop just click on this circle

0:43:11.440,0:43:17.839
um and you can put in any backdrop

0:43:14.480,0:43:20.000
that you'd like so i'll put on hearts

0:43:17.839,0:43:21.280
uh you could choose to put a message in

0:43:20.000,0:43:24.640
this heart

0:43:21.280,0:43:26.720
so you could say love you mom

0:43:24.640,0:43:28.640
or dad we don't have to be specific

0:43:26.720,0:43:30.319
about about one or the other

0:43:28.640,0:43:31.839
um we haven't talked to you about

0:43:30.319,0:43:33.280
drawing yet but i think

0:43:31.839,0:43:35.839
that it's fun to just try to figure

0:43:33.280,0:43:38.240
things out um so so there's one

0:43:35.839,0:43:40.160
that one says love you mom i'm gonna

0:43:38.240,0:43:43.520
make another one

0:43:40.160,0:43:43.520
maybe i'll make a jungle

0:43:43.599,0:43:46.880
you could put things on here if you

0:43:45.040,0:43:48.240
wanted you could put text on here so

0:43:46.880,0:43:51.599
this one i'm going to say

0:43:48.240,0:43:51.599
welcome to the jungle

0:43:52.800,0:43:56.960
by the way you can do things like

0:43:54.359,0:43:58.880
resizing uh you can play with different

0:43:56.960,0:44:01.599
colors on things

0:43:58.880,0:44:02.160
you could do uh whatever you wanted um

0:44:01.599,0:44:04.640
i'm

0:44:02.160,0:44:05.920
not planning in this lecture to help you

0:44:04.640,0:44:08.800
make cool backgrounds

0:44:05.920,0:44:10.400
because i just want you to play right

0:44:08.800,0:44:10.960
and so pick whatever you think would be

0:44:10.400,0:44:14.720
a back

0:44:10.960,0:44:18.240
uh ground that's fun uh maybe you'll

0:44:14.720,0:44:21.440
give a message like can

0:44:18.240,0:44:22.880
we get into the pool so you could say

0:44:21.440,0:44:25.040
hey mom play this game

0:44:22.880,0:44:27.200
or hey dad play this game and then it

0:44:25.040,0:44:28.480
would expose this question of uh can we

0:44:27.200,0:44:30.079
get into the pool

0:44:28.480,0:44:31.520
so you can see that right now i have

0:44:30.079,0:44:33.760
four possible

0:44:31.520,0:44:35.440
hidden backdrops i could keep making

0:44:33.760,0:44:37.359
more

0:44:35.440,0:44:39.040
they don't have to be customized right

0:44:37.359,0:44:40.400
so i could just like put on one of these

0:44:39.040,0:44:43.680
images

0:44:40.400,0:44:45.839
if you know how to do it you can also

0:44:43.680,0:44:47.040
get things from the internet again not

0:44:45.839,0:44:48.480
going to show you this today

0:44:47.040,0:44:49.839
and then you could upload that image

0:44:48.480,0:44:51.040
here so you can put like a picture of

0:44:49.839,0:44:54.319
yourself on there

0:44:51.040,0:44:54.800
that'd be kind of fun to do and make as

0:44:54.319,0:44:58.640
many

0:44:54.800,0:45:01.920
uh as you want i currently have uh

0:44:58.640,0:45:02.800
two through seven as options so i think

0:45:01.920,0:45:04.560
that that's

0:45:02.800,0:45:06.560
enough for me so i'm gonna give my

0:45:04.560,0:45:08.560
campers just a minute to make a few more

0:45:06.560,0:45:09.839
uh and then we're gonna move forwards uh

0:45:08.560,0:45:11.920
with the code

0:45:09.839,0:45:13.440
all right so my campers went in uh and

0:45:11.920,0:45:15.520
they added a bunch of uh

0:45:13.440,0:45:17.119
grids uh let's look at the solution real

0:45:15.520,0:45:17.680
quick to review how this is gonna work

0:45:17.119,0:45:20.480
so

0:45:17.680,0:45:21.920
while you're drawing the the grid um

0:45:20.480,0:45:25.200
it's some backdrop

0:45:21.920,0:45:27.440
and then as soon as the grid is done

0:45:25.200,0:45:28.880
it switches to some secret backdrop

0:45:27.440,0:45:29.680
right so it's while you're drawing it's

0:45:28.880,0:45:31.599
a grid

0:45:29.680,0:45:33.040
and then it changed to some secret this

0:45:31.599,0:45:35.839
one always confuses me

0:45:33.040,0:45:38.079
and so that's our goal so let's go into

0:45:35.839,0:45:41.760
our code on our backdrop

0:45:38.079,0:45:43.440
so backdrop code so when the green flag

0:45:41.760,0:45:44.079
is clicked i want to start off on the

0:45:43.440,0:45:47.040
grid

0:45:44.079,0:45:48.000
so i'm going to go to looks i'm going to

0:45:47.040,0:45:51.680
put in a

0:45:48.000,0:45:53.359
switch backdrop to xy grid

0:45:51.680,0:45:55.119
so that's kind of like my first my first

0:45:53.359,0:45:56.880
grid

0:45:55.119,0:45:58.319
um and so right now if i run it you can

0:45:56.880,0:46:00.000
see it switches to that grid but it's

0:45:58.319,0:46:02.400
going to stay as that grid

0:46:00.000,0:46:03.119
based on the code that i have right now

0:46:02.400,0:46:06.079
so let's

0:46:03.119,0:46:07.200
after it's done drawing let's switch it

0:46:06.079,0:46:08.880
right

0:46:07.200,0:46:10.480
and so the the moment when it's done

0:46:08.880,0:46:14.400
drawing the grid is down here

0:46:10.480,0:46:17.200
so just before um

0:46:14.400,0:46:19.119
oops uh let's grab it right there just

0:46:17.200,0:46:20.880
before we broadcast this event

0:46:19.119,0:46:22.640
let's switch the backdrop to something

0:46:20.880,0:46:25.599
different now we could

0:46:22.640,0:46:27.119
uh hard code that but then that wouldn't

0:46:25.599,0:46:28.560
be random right so we could say like

0:46:27.119,0:46:31.119
switch to hearts

0:46:28.560,0:46:32.480
but now every time you play the game um

0:46:31.119,0:46:34.720
it's going to switch it to

0:46:32.480,0:46:36.000
uh to your heart right so we want to

0:46:34.720,0:46:38.000
randomly pick

0:46:36.000,0:46:40.240
that background and so that's where

0:46:38.000,0:46:43.440
operators come in

0:46:40.240,0:46:47.359
and so we want um n operators pick

0:46:43.440,0:46:49.359
random now one nice thing about costumes

0:46:47.359,0:46:50.560
is you can refer to them by name so this

0:46:49.359,0:46:53.440
one was called hearts

0:46:50.560,0:46:54.000
uh this one's called xy grid or number

0:46:53.440,0:46:56.240
right

0:46:54.000,0:46:57.680
so i could also say switch to number one

0:46:56.240,0:46:59.680
and that would be the xy grid

0:46:57.680,0:47:00.960
or number two so what i want to do is i

0:46:59.680,0:47:03.599
want to decide how many

0:47:00.960,0:47:05.040
random things do i have so for me uh my

0:47:03.599,0:47:07.680
first value is a two

0:47:05.040,0:47:08.240
so i want to pick a number between two

0:47:07.680,0:47:10.079
um

0:47:08.240,0:47:11.520
and then for me it looks like i've got a

0:47:10.079,0:47:14.319
seven in here as well

0:47:11.520,0:47:15.839
so pick something between two uh and

0:47:14.319,0:47:18.079
seven

0:47:15.839,0:47:18.880
so it'll always be the xy grid while

0:47:18.079,0:47:20.480
it's drawing

0:47:18.880,0:47:22.559
so i it's always the expert grid while

0:47:20.480,0:47:24.880
it's drawing but then after that

0:47:22.559,0:47:26.640
uh it's random it's random number

0:47:24.880,0:47:28.079
generator is not amazing

0:47:26.640,0:47:30.640
you might see the same thing a couple

0:47:28.079,0:47:33.359
times uh but right now it's the heart

0:47:30.640,0:47:34.319
and then if i run it again this time it

0:47:33.359,0:47:36.160
looks like it's

0:47:34.319,0:47:38.079
the jungle right so it says welcome to

0:47:36.160,0:47:40.880
the jungle so it's kind of a neat little

0:47:38.079,0:47:41.520
uh reveal game by the way when you stop

0:47:40.880,0:47:43.599
the game

0:47:41.520,0:47:44.880
uh if you stop it manually it will just

0:47:43.599,0:47:47.520
show you the rest of the board

0:47:44.880,0:47:48.960
i consider that a feature right so um

0:47:47.520,0:47:50.960
not not worried about it

0:47:48.960,0:47:53.359
but that is how the game works so every

0:47:50.960,0:47:56.000
time it's different

0:47:53.359,0:47:57.119
now last feature that we'd like to add

0:47:56.000,0:47:59.440
is when you finish

0:47:57.119,0:48:00.160
mowing the lawn i feel like something

0:47:59.440,0:48:02.559
should happen

0:48:00.160,0:48:04.240
right so like i finished uh getting the

0:48:02.559,0:48:06.240
last square

0:48:04.240,0:48:08.000
but right now in our game nothing will

0:48:06.240,0:48:11.280
happen right so we hit

0:48:08.000,0:48:13.119
num grass cut 48 um but nothing

0:48:11.280,0:48:14.480
nothing happened um and as you might

0:48:13.119,0:48:15.760
recall from the solution it plays that

0:48:14.480,0:48:16.720
really loud scary sound you guys

0:48:15.760,0:48:19.599
remember that

0:48:16.720,0:48:20.960
yes so let's let's add code this will be

0:48:19.599,0:48:23.119
our last feature

0:48:20.960,0:48:25.119
that does something when the number of

0:48:23.119,0:48:27.359
grass cut is equal to 48.

0:48:25.119,0:48:29.280
so somebody has to be responsible for

0:48:27.359,0:48:29.839
this right who's going to be checking uh

0:48:29.280,0:48:32.000
if the num

0:48:29.839,0:48:33.760
grass cut is equal to 48 we could put it

0:48:32.000,0:48:35.680
in a number of places

0:48:33.760,0:48:37.839
we could let the grass check for it that

0:48:35.680,0:48:40.559
seems a little strange

0:48:37.839,0:48:42.000
we could let the background check for it

0:48:40.559,0:48:43.760
that would that would be okay

0:48:42.000,0:48:45.839
the only thing about the backdrop is it

0:48:43.760,0:48:48.079
doesn't have a forever loop right so

0:48:45.839,0:48:49.520
we'd have to make one so what i'm going

0:48:48.079,0:48:53.280
to do is i'm going to have the

0:48:49.520,0:48:55.520
robot mower check for it just because

0:48:53.280,0:48:56.319
he's got a forever loop he's always

0:48:55.520,0:48:58.240
present

0:48:56.319,0:48:59.839
so i'm going to go into the robot mower

0:48:58.240,0:49:03.440
and he's going to be the one

0:48:59.839,0:49:06.480
that checks for game over a check

0:49:03.440,0:49:07.040
is a control if statement so go ahead

0:49:06.480,0:49:10.400
and grab

0:49:07.040,0:49:13.839
an if statement here and so

0:49:10.400,0:49:15.760
if some condition is true then

0:49:13.839,0:49:18.480
run this code in here normally our

0:49:15.760,0:49:19.760
conditions have been sensing conditions

0:49:18.480,0:49:21.119
but this time we're going to do

0:49:19.760,0:49:23.280
something different we're going to go

0:49:21.119,0:49:24.960
into operators

0:49:23.280,0:49:26.800
and we're going to find the equals

0:49:24.960,0:49:28.880
operator

0:49:26.800,0:49:30.079
and so we're going to say if the thing

0:49:28.880,0:49:32.000
on the left is equal to

0:49:30.079,0:49:34.079
the thing on the right then run this

0:49:32.000,0:49:35.119
code and so one of them should be the

0:49:34.079,0:49:38.160
variable

0:49:35.119,0:49:40.000
num grass cut and then the other should

0:49:38.160,0:49:42.720
be the number 48

0:49:40.000,0:49:43.359
so 48 is the special number which means

0:49:42.720,0:49:46.400
you've cut

0:49:43.359,0:49:49.839
all the grass so when that happens

0:49:46.400,0:49:51.200
we want to play a sound if you go into

0:49:49.839,0:49:52.960
the sounds tab

0:49:51.200,0:49:54.640
you can see that the lawnmower right now

0:49:52.960,0:49:55.920
apparently he doesn't have any sounds

0:49:54.640,0:49:58.160
that he knows how to play

0:49:55.920,0:50:00.079
so let's pick a sound that we want him

0:49:58.160,0:50:02.960
to play so to pick a sound i'm going to

0:50:00.079,0:50:05.359
click on choose a sound down here

0:50:02.960,0:50:06.000
and the one that i played in the

0:50:05.359,0:50:09.119
solution

0:50:06.000,0:50:10.960
is ta-da so i'm going to pick ta-da

0:50:09.119,0:50:12.640
again if you would like to pick a

0:50:10.960,0:50:13.920
different sound you just kind of hover

0:50:12.640,0:50:16.400
over it

0:50:13.920,0:50:17.119
and it'll play it for you and you can

0:50:16.400,0:50:19.359
listen to

0:50:17.119,0:50:20.880
uh to the different sounds but i think

0:50:19.359,0:50:23.119
ta-da is a pretty good one if i hover

0:50:20.880,0:50:25.920
over it

0:50:23.119,0:50:27.520
you can see it's this nice loud ta-da so

0:50:25.920,0:50:30.400
once you've found the one you want

0:50:27.520,0:50:31.119
uh just click in the middle of it and

0:50:30.400,0:50:34.160
it'll

0:50:31.119,0:50:37.359
add it to this sprite sound library

0:50:34.160,0:50:40.160
so now this sprite is capable of playing

0:50:37.359,0:50:41.040
the ta-da sound now we've got to do it

0:50:40.160,0:50:46.240
in code right

0:50:41.040,0:50:49.520
so go into code go into sound

0:50:46.240,0:50:52.880
and uh find where it says play

0:50:49.520,0:50:55.280
sound ta-dah until done

0:50:52.880,0:50:56.400
so i'm going to play sound ta-dah until

0:50:55.280,0:50:59.440
done

0:50:56.400,0:51:01.359
now after i play the sound i want to

0:50:59.440,0:51:02.960
finish the game right so the game's

0:51:01.359,0:51:04.240
going to be over so i'm going to go to

0:51:02.960,0:51:07.680
control

0:51:04.240,0:51:12.079
and i'm going to grab a stop all

0:51:07.680,0:51:14.240
so this is going to play a sound

0:51:12.079,0:51:16.240
really loud and then it's going to shut

0:51:14.240,0:51:18.160
the game down so the game is over at

0:51:16.240,0:51:19.520
that point

0:51:18.160,0:51:21.440
i think i'm going to run it and see if

0:51:19.520,0:51:23.599
it works if it does work

0:51:21.440,0:51:24.480
then i'm gonna call myself pretty happy

0:51:23.599,0:51:27.040
about it

0:51:24.480,0:51:27.520
so uh to test it i kind of have to just

0:51:27.040,0:51:30.880
do

0:51:27.520,0:51:32.400
all the mowing so i'm gonna mo mo mo

0:51:30.880,0:51:34.240
by the way it's your game if you wanna

0:51:32.400,0:51:35.520
speed up the mower a lot of people like

0:51:34.240,0:51:36.720
to do that feel free

0:51:35.520,0:51:40.559
to go ahead so all right let's talk

0:51:36.720,0:51:40.559
about 44 and get the last bit

0:51:41.280,0:51:45.040
that was some seriously loud to dying uh

0:51:44.079,0:51:47.839
totally worked

0:51:45.040,0:51:49.280
so it says ta-da and then the game

0:51:47.839,0:51:52.160
finished

0:51:49.280,0:51:54.880
my game is done what i like to do is my

0:51:52.160,0:51:56.400
last step is i like to share it publicly

0:51:54.880,0:51:59.119
so i'm going to click on this share

0:51:56.400,0:51:59.839
button up here you'll only get a share

0:51:59.119,0:52:02.000
button

0:51:59.839,0:52:03.839
if you have created an account and

0:52:02.000,0:52:06.880
validated an email address

0:52:03.839,0:52:08.240
but i like to do that and then right now

0:52:06.880,0:52:10.079
in the instructions it says use the

0:52:08.240,0:52:11.359
arrow keys to mow the lawn

0:52:10.079,0:52:13.119
i think that those are lovely

0:52:11.359,0:52:14.960
instructions that must have come from

0:52:13.119,0:52:17.040
the remix

0:52:14.960,0:52:18.160
and what i love to do is that this url

0:52:17.040,0:52:20.319
now

0:52:18.160,0:52:21.359
is something that you could share with

0:52:20.319,0:52:22.640
friends and family

0:52:21.359,0:52:24.800
so you can share this with whoever you

0:52:22.640,0:52:26.160
want so you just copy this url and send

0:52:24.800,0:52:27.680
an email to grandma

0:52:26.160,0:52:29.599
and say check out the cool game that i

0:52:27.680,0:52:31.440
made alright so

0:52:29.599,0:52:33.440
i've got a few closing remarks i want to

0:52:31.440,0:52:34.319
make but actually i want to see how my

0:52:33.440,0:52:36.480
campers

0:52:34.319,0:52:38.559
are doing first so we're going to go see

0:52:36.480,0:52:40.800
how mckinley and keegan did

0:52:38.559,0:52:42.400
and we're going to check out their games

0:52:40.800,0:52:44.400
and see how they came out

0:52:42.400,0:52:46.160
all right keegan let's go ahead and see

0:52:44.400,0:52:48.880
a demo of yours

0:52:46.160,0:52:50.400
so it looks like you've got um the lawn

0:52:48.880,0:52:52.559
set up which is great

0:52:50.400,0:52:53.920
yeah the only real area for creativity

0:52:52.559,0:52:56.160
in this game

0:52:53.920,0:52:58.000
is what is the like hidden thing behind

0:52:56.160,0:52:59.760
it some games will have an opportunity

0:52:58.000,0:53:01.760
for a lot of creativity

0:52:59.760,0:53:03.599
but this one uh is really just the the

0:53:01.760,0:53:05.359
background image so looks like keegan

0:53:03.599,0:53:06.559
has a secret passage as one of his

0:53:05.359,0:53:08.640
background images

0:53:06.559,0:53:09.760
i'm sure he's got quite a few let's go

0:53:08.640,0:53:14.800
and have him finish

0:53:09.760,0:53:16.400
just so we can hear his sound lovely

0:53:14.800,0:53:17.760
um great i'm going to click play again

0:53:16.400,0:53:19.119
just so we can see that switches to a

0:53:17.760,0:53:20.480
different image and then we'll let [ __ ]

0:53:19.119,0:53:22.559
go

0:53:20.480,0:53:23.760
uh so he's got some other image looks

0:53:22.559,0:53:25.040
like that was the connecting with code

0:53:23.760,0:53:29.839
one great

0:53:25.040,0:53:29.839
all right mckinley

0:53:30.720,0:53:36.160
i don't know why i did that

0:53:34.240,0:53:37.520
so a bug in there that i'm sure that

0:53:36.160,0:53:40.480
we'll be able to fix

0:53:37.520,0:53:41.040
um but it looks like she has a

0:53:40.480,0:53:43.440
functional

0:53:41.040,0:53:45.200
lawnmower game um it looks like she's

0:53:43.440,0:53:46.960
got a lot of fun background image

0:53:45.200,0:53:48.000
it looks like she made one wow very

0:53:46.960,0:53:48.880
complex did you make that yourself

0:53:48.000,0:53:52.400
mckinley

0:53:48.880,0:53:54.559
it was on a different game i made

0:53:52.400,0:53:56.640
she used the kaleidoscope version to

0:53:54.559,0:53:58.559
make that for herself great

0:53:56.640,0:54:00.079
uh great you guys have fun oh there's

0:53:58.559,0:54:02.079
your kaleidoscope program where you make

0:54:00.079,0:54:03.440
backgrounds

0:54:02.079,0:54:05.119
do you guys have fun with the lawnmower

0:54:03.440,0:54:07.280
game today yes

0:54:05.119,0:54:08.960
is the uh challenge of the games this

0:54:07.280,0:54:11.839
week quite a bit higher than it was last

0:54:08.960,0:54:11.839
week

0:54:12.079,0:54:16.559
all right so uh we hope that you had fun

0:54:14.000,0:54:18.079
today uh the real goal is that you learn

0:54:16.559,0:54:20.400
that that coding is fun

0:54:18.079,0:54:22.720
and that you can do this you can see how

0:54:20.400,0:54:23.440
we used a lot of math skills math and

0:54:22.720,0:54:25.839
code

0:54:23.440,0:54:27.599
man they go hand in hand right we

0:54:25.839,0:54:29.040
learned about doing things in sequence

0:54:27.599,0:54:30.720
we learned about how different sprites

0:54:29.040,0:54:32.160
have their own code

0:54:30.720,0:54:34.319
and we also learned one of the best

0:54:32.160,0:54:36.960
tricks is that you can have one sprite

0:54:34.319,0:54:38.720
with many many clones of it so it was a

0:54:36.960,0:54:40.240
huge first day

0:54:38.720,0:54:41.599
i chose to put a big one right off the

0:54:40.240,0:54:42.799

0:54:41.599,0:54:44.240

0:54:44.240,0:54:47.040

0:54:46.160,0:54:50.240
through them

0:54:47.040,0:54:52.640
but my hope is that you learn a lot

0:54:50.240,0:54:54.720

0:54:52.640,0:54:55.440
